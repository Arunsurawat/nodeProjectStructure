PREFACE
Introduction
The Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC) is a state regulation promulgated by the Virginia
Board  of  Housing  and  Community  Development,  a  Governor-appointed  board,  for  the  purpose  of
establishing minimum regulations to govern the construction and maintenance of buildings and struc-
tures.
The provisions of the USBC are based on nationally recognized model building and fire codes pub-
lished by the International Code Council, Inc. The model codes are made part of the USBC through a
regulatory process known as incorporation by reference. The USBC also contains administrative provi-
sions governing the use of the model codes and establishing requirements for the enforcement of the
code by the local building departments and other code enforcement agencies.
In keeping with the designations of the USBC used previously, since the 2021 editions of the Inter-
national  Codes  are  incorporated  by  reference  into  this  version  of  the  USBC,  it  is  known  as  the  2021
edition of the USBC.
Arrangement
The USBC is part of the Virginia Administrative Code (VAC), the official compilation of state regulations
published under the authority and guidance of the Virginia Code Commission. Due to the difference in
the section numbering system between the VAC and the model codes incorporated by reference into
the USBC, the USBC utilizes a dual section numbering system. In the USBC, the VAC section numbers
are listed first, followed by a section number matching the model code system. In this printing of the
USBC,  the  VAC  section  numbers  are  omitted  and  only  the  model  code  numbering  system  is  utilized.
The version of the USBC containing both the VAC section numbers and the model code numbering can
be  accessed  through  Virginia’s  Legislative  Information  System  (LIS)  here:  https://law.lis.virginia.gov/
admincode/title13/agency5/.
Overview
The USBC is divided into three stand-alone parts. Part I contains regulations specific to the construc-
tion of new buildings and structures and is known as the Virginia Construction Code. Part II contains
regulations specific to the rehabilitation of existing buildings, including repair, alterations, additions
and change of occupancy in existing buildings and structures, and is known as the Virginia Existing
Building  Code.  Part  III  of  the  USBC  contains  the  regulations  for  the  maintenance  of  existing  struc-
tures which is enforced at the option of the local governments. It is known as the Virginia Mainte-
nance Code.
Codes Purchased from ICC
The 2021 edition of the USBC is being made available in pamphlet form as in past editions of the USBC. In
addition to the pamphlet form of the USBC published by DHCD, the International Code Council (ICC) pub-
lishes  versions  of  the  Virginia  Construction  Code, Virginia  Existing  Building  Code, Virginia  Maintenance
Code and a series of Virginia specific trade codes.

Marginal Markings
In the ICC published versions, marginal markings are provided to distinguish between text which is
part of the International Codes and text which is part of the state regulations. Double vertical lines
in the margins within the body of the codes indicate state amendments to the International Codes.
As  in  the  standard  printings  of  the  International  Codes,  a  single  vertical  line  in  the  margins  within
the  body  of  the  code  indicates  a  technical  change  from  the  previous  edition  of  the  International
Codes. 
Deletions  from  the  previous  editions  of  the  International  Codes  are  indicated  in  the  form  of  an
arrow () in the margin where an entire section, paragraph, exception or table has been deleted or
an item in a list of items or a table has been deleted. Deletions to the Virginia Code are indicated
with an open caret (>) in the margin.

xii2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE

2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE1-1
CHAPTER 1
ADMINISTRATION
SECTION 101
GENERAL
101.1  Short  title.  The  Virginia  Uniform  Statewide  Building
Code,  Part  II,  Existing  Buildings,  may  be  cited  as  the  “Vir-
ginia Existing Building Code” or as the “VEBC.”
101.2  Incorporation  by  reference.  Chapters  2–16  of  the
2021 International Existing Building Code
®
, published by the
International  Code  Council,  Inc.,  are  adopted  and  incorpo-
rated by reference to be an enforceable part of the VEBC. The
term  “IEBC
®
”  means  the  2021  International  Existing  Build-
ing  Code,  published  by  the  International  Code  Council,  Inc.
Any codes and standards referenced in the IEBC are also con-
sidered  to  be  part  of  the  incorporation  by  reference,  except
that such codes and standards are used only to the prescribed
extent of each such reference. 
101.3 Numbering system. A dual numbering system is used
in  the  VEBC  to  correlate  the  numbering  system  of  the  Vir-
ginia Administrative Code with the numbering system of the
IEBC. IEBC numbering system designations are provided in
the  catchlines  of  the  Virginia  Administrative  Code  sections
and  cross  references  between  sections  or  chapters  of  the
VEBC  use  only  the  IEBC  numbering  system  designations.
The  term  “chapter”  is  used  in  the  context  of  the  numbering
system of the IEBC and may mean a chapter in the VEBC, a
chapter in the IEBC or a chapter in a referenced code or stan-
dard,  depending  on  the  context  of  the  use  of  the  term.  The
term “chapter” is not used to designate a chapter of the Vir-
ginia Administrative Code, unless clearly indicated. 
101.4 Arrangement of code provisions. The VEBC is com-
prised of the combination of (i) the provisions of Chapter 1,
Administration, which are established herein, (ii) Chapters 2–
16 of the IEBC, which are incorporated by reference in Sec-
tion 101.2, and (iii) the changes to the text of the incorporated
chapters  of  the  IEBC  that  are  specifically  identified,  includ-
ing any new chapters added. The terminology “changes to the
text of the incorporated chapters of the IEBC that are specifi-
cally identified, including any new chapters added” shall also
be  referred  to  as  the  “state  amendments  to  the  IEBC.”  Such
state amendments to the IEBC are set out using correspond-
ing chapter and section numbers of the IEBC numbering sys-
tem.   In   addition,   since   Chapter   1   of   the   IEBC   is   not
incorporated  as  part  of  the  VEBC,  any  reference  to  a  provi-
sion of Chapter 1 of the IEBC in the provisions of Chapters
2–16  of  the  IEBC  is  generally  invalid.  However,  where  the
purpose  of  such  a  reference  would  clearly  correspond  to  a
provision of Chapter 1 established herein, then the reference
may be construed to be a valid reference to such correspond-
ing Chapter 1 provision. 
101.5 Use of terminology and notes. The provisions of this
code shall be used as follows:
1.  The term “this code,” or “the code,” where used in the
provisions of Chapter 1, in Chapters 2–16 of the IEBC,
or  in  the  state  amendments  to  the  IEBC,  means  the
VEBC, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
2.  The  term  “this  code,”  or  “the  code,”  where  used  in  a
code  or  standard  referenced  in  the  VEBC,  means  that
code  or  standard,  unless  the  context  clearly  indicates
otherwise. 
3.  The term “USBC,” where used in this code, means the
Virginia Construction Code (VCC), unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise. 
4.  The use of notes in Chapter 1 is to provide information
only and shall not be construed as changing the mean-
ing of any code provision. 
5.  Notes  in  the  IEBC,  in  the  codes  and  standards  refer-
enced  in  the  IEBC  and  in  the state amendments to the
IEBC  may  modify  the  content  of  a  related  provision
and shall be considered to be a valid part of the provi-
sion, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
6.  References to International Codes and standards, where
used  in  this  code,  include  state  amendments  made  to
those International Codes and standards in the VCC.
Note:  See  Section  101.2  of  the  VCC  for  a  list  of  major
codes and standards referenced in the VCC.
101.6 Order of precedence. The provisions of this code shall
be used as follows: 
1.  The provisions of Chapter 1 of this code supersede any
provisions  of  Chapters  2–16  of  the  IEBC  that  address
the  same  subject  matter  and  impose  differing  require-
ments. 
2.  The provisions of Chapter 1 of this code supersede any
provisions of the codes and standards referenced in the
IEBC that address the same subject matter and impose
differing requirements. 
3.  The state amendments to the IEBC supersede any pro-
visions of Chapters 2–16 of the IEBC that address the
same subject matter and impose differing requirements. 
4.  The state amendments to the IEBC supersede any pro-
visions  of  the  codes  and  standards  referenced  in  the
IEBC that address the same subject matter and impose
differing requirements. 
5.  The provisions of Chapters 2–16 of the IEBC supersede
any provisions of the codes and standards referenced in
the  IEBC  that  address  the  same  subject  matter  and
impose differing requirements. 
101.7 Administrative provisions. The provisions of Chap-
ter  1  establish  administrative  requirements,  which  include
but  are  not  limited  to  provisions  relating  to  the  scope  and
enforcement of the code. Any provisions of Chapters 2–16
of  the  IEBC  or  any  provisions  of  the  codes  and  standards
referenced in the IEBC that address the same subject matter
to a lesser or greater extent are deleted and replaced by the
provisions   of   Chapter   1.   Further,   any   administrative

ADMINISTRATION
1-22021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE
requirements  contained  in  the  state  amendments  to  the
IEBC shall be given the same precedence as the provisions
of Chapter 1. Notwithstanding the above, where administra-
tive  requirements  of  Chapters  2–16  of  the  IEBC  or  of  the
codes and standards referenced in the IEBC are specifically
identified as valid administrative requirements in Chapter 1
of  this  code  or  in  the  state  amendments  to  the  IEBC,  then
such requirements are not deleted and replaced. 
Note:  The  purpose  of  this  provision  is  to  eliminate  over-
lap,  conflicts  and  duplication  by  providing  a  single  stan-
dard   for   administrative,   procedural   and   enforcement
requirements of this code. 
101.8 Definitions. The definitions of terms used in this code
are  contained  in  Chapter  2  along  with  specific  provisions
addressing  the  use  of  definitions.  Terms  may  be  defined  in
other chapters or provisions of the code and such definitions
are also valid. 
SECTION 102
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
102.1 Purpose. In accordance with § 36-99.01 of the Code
of Virginia, the General Assembly of Virginia has declared
that (i) there is an urgent need to improve the housing con-
ditions of low and moderate income individuals and fami-
lies,    many    of    whom    live    in    substandard    housing,
particularly  in  the  older  cities  of  the  Commonwealth;  (ii)
there are large numbers of older residential buildings in the
Commonwealth,  both  occupied  and  vacant,  which  are  in
urgent  need  of  rehabilitation  and  must  be  rehabilitated  if
the  state’s  citizens  are  to  be  housed  in  decent,  sound,  and
sanitary conditions; and (iii) the application of those build-
ing  code  requirements  currently  in  force  to  housing  reha-
bilitation has sometimes led to the imposition of costly and
time-consuming  requirements  that  result  in  a  significant
reduction  in  the  amount  of  rehabilitation  activity  taking
place.
The  General  Assembly  further  declares  that  (i)  there  is  an
urgent  need  to  improve  the  existing  condition  of  many  of  the
Commonwealth’s stock of commercial properties, particularly
in older cities; (ii) there are large numbers of older commercial
buildings  in  the  Commonwealth,  both  occupied  and  vacant,
that are in urgent need of rehabilitation and that must be reha-
bilitated  if  the  citizens  of  the  Commonwealth  are  to  be  pro-
vided with decent, sound and sanitary work spaces; and (iii) the
application of the existing building code to such rehabilitation
has  sometimes  led  to  the  imposition  of  costly  and  time-con-
suming requirements that result in a significant reduction in the
amount of rehabilitation activity taking place.
102.2  Scope.  The  provisions  of  this  code  shall  govern  con-
struction  and  rehabilitation  activities  in  existing buildings
and structures.
102.2.1  Change  of  occupancy  to  Group  I-2  or  I-3. A
change  of  occupancy  to  Group  I-2  or  I-3  from  another
occupancy classification shall comply with the provisions
of the VCC as required for new construction, not Chapter
7 of this code. All other provisions of the VEBC, includ-
ing change of occupancy within an existing Group I-2 or I-
3 classification, are applicable to Group I-2 or I-3.
102.2.2  Reconstruction,  alteration,  or  repair  in  Group
R-5 occupancies. Compliance with this section shall be an
acceptable  alternative  to  compliance  with  this  code  at  the
discretion of the owner or owner’s agent. The VCC may be
used  for  the  reconstruction,  alteration,  or  repair  of  Group
R-5 buildings or structures subject to the following criteria:
1.  Any  reconstruction,  
alteration or  repair  shall  not
adversely  affect  the  performance  of  the  building  or
structure,  or  cause  the  building  or  structure  to
become unsafe or lower existing levels of health and
safety.
2.  Parts  of  the  building or  structure  not  being  recon-
structed, altered, or repaired shall not be required to
comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  VCC  applica-
ble to newly constructed buildings or structures.
3.  The  installation  of  material  or  equipment,  or  both,
that  is  neither  required  nor  prohibited  shall  only  be
required to comply with the provisions of the VCC
relating  to  the  safe  installation  of  such  material  or
equipment.
4.  Material  or  equipment,  or  both,  may  be  replaced  in
the  same  location  with  material  or  equipment of  a
similar kind or capacity.
5.  In  accordance  with  §  36-99.2  of  the  Code  of  Vir-
ginia, installation or replacement of glass shall com-
ply with Section R308 or Chapter 24 of the VCC.
Exceptions:
1.  This section shall not be construed to permit non-
compliance  with  any  applicable  flood  load  or
flood-resistant  construction  requirements  of  the
VCC.
2.  Reconstructed   decks,   balconies,   porches,   and
similar structures located 30 inches (762 mm) or
more  above  grade  shall  meet  the  current  code
provisions  for  structural  loading  capacity,  con-
nections, and structural attachment. This require-
ment  excludes  the  configuration  and  height  of
handrails and guardrails.
3.  Repair  or  replacement  of  smoke  alarms  shall  be
with  devices  listed  in  accordance  with  UL217
and that are no more than 10 years from the date
of  manufacture.  Battery-only  powered  devices
shall be powered by a 10-year sealed battery.
102.2.3  Additions.  Where  one  or  more  newly  con-
structed  fire  walls  that  comply  with  Section  706  of  the
VCC  is  provided  between  an  addition  and  the  existing
building  or  structure  or  portions  thereof,  the  addition
shall  be  considered  a  separate  building,  and  therefore,
not an addition within the scope of this code. Such sepa-
rate building, including the fire wall, shall be constructed
in accordance with the VCC and shall not place the exist-
ing  building  or  structure  in  nonconformance  with  the
building code under which the existing building or struc-
ture or the affected portions thereof was built, or as pre-
viously approved. 

ADMINISTRATION
2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE1-3
SECTION 103
APPLICATION OF CODE
103.1  General.  All  administrative  provisions  of  the  VCC,
including requirements for permits, inspections and approvals
by the local building department, provisions for appeals from
decisions of the local building department and the issuance of
modifications,  are  applicable  to  the  use  of  this  code,  except
where this code sets out differing requirements. Where there
is  a  conflict  between  a  general  requirement  and  a  specific
requirement in the VEBC, the specific requirement shall gov-
ern.
103.1.1  Use  of  performance  code.  Compliance  with  the
provisions  of  a  nationally  recognized  performance  code
when  approved  as  a  modification  shall  be  considered  to
constitute compliance with this code. All documents sub-
mitted as part of such consideration shall be retained in the
permanent records of the local building department.
103.1.2  Preliminary  meeting. When requested by a pro-
spective  permit  applicant  or  when  determined  necessary
by  the  code  official,  the code  official  shall  meet  with  the
prospective permit applicant prior to the application for a
permit to discuss plans for the proposed work or change of
occupancy in order to establish the specific applicability of
the provisions of this code.
103.2 Change of occupancy. A building or structure under-
going  a  change  of  occupancy  shall  comply  with  the  provi-
sions of this code for change of occupancy except as provided
for  in  Section  102.2.1  for  Group  I-2  or  I-3.  Permitting,
inspections and certificate of occupancy issuance shall be in
accordance with the administrative provisions of the VCC.
When impractical to achieve compliance with this code for
the new occupancy, the building official shall consider modi-
fications  upon  application  and  as  provided  for  in  Section
106.3 of the VCC.
103.3 Retrofit requirements. The local building department
shall enforce the provisions of Section 1101 that require cer-
tain existing buildings  to  be  retrofitted  with  fire  protection
systems  and  other  safety  equipment. Retroactive fire protec-
tion system requirements contained in the International Fire
Code  shall  not  be  applicable  unless  required  for  compliance
with the provisions of Section 1101.
103.4  Nonrequired  equipment.  The  following  criteria  for
nonrequired equipment  are  in  accordance  with  §  36-103  of
the  Code  of  Virginia.  Building  owners  may  elect  to  install
partial or full fire alarms or other safety equipment that was
not required by the edition of the VCC in effect at the time a
building  was  constructed  without  meeting  current  require-
ments of the code, provided the installation does not create a
hazardous condition. Permits for installation shall be obtained
in accordance with the VCC. In addition, as a requirement of
this   code,   when   such   nonrequired   equipment   is   to   be
installed, the building official shall notify the appropriate fire
official or fire chief.
103.4.1  Reduction  in  function  or  discontinuance  of
nonrequired  fire  protection  systems.  When  a  nonre-
quired fire protection system is to be reduced in function
or discontinued, it shall be done in such a manner so as not
to  create  a  false  sense  of  protection.  Generally,  in  such
cases,  any  features  visible  from  interior  areas  shall  be
removed,  such  as  sprinkler  heads,  smoke  detectors,  or
alarm  panels  or  devices,  but  any  wiring  or  piping  hidden
within   the   construction   of   the   building   may   remain.
Approval of the proposed method of reduction or discon-
tinuance shall be obtained from the building official.
103.5 Requirements relating to maintenance.
 Any require-
ments  of  the  IEBC  requiring  the  maintenance  of  existing
buildings or structures are invalid.
Note: Requirements for the maintenance of existing build-
ings and structures and for unsafe conditions are contained
in the Virginia Property Maintenance Code (VPMC).
103.6 Use of Appendix A. Appendix A of the IEBC provides
guidelines  for  the  seismic  retrofit  of  existing  buildings.  The
use of this appendix is not mandatory but shall be permitted
to be utilized at the option of an owner, the owner’s agent or
the registered design professional (RDP) involved in a reha-
bilitation project. However, in no case shall the use of Appen-
dix  A  be  construed  to  authorize  the  lowering  of  existing
levels  of  health  or  safety  in  buildings  or  structures  being
rehabilitated.
103.7 Use of Appendix B. Appendix B of the IEBC provides
supplementary  accessibility  requirements  for  existing  build-
ings  and  facilities.  All  applicable  requirements  of  Appendix
B shall be met in buildings and structures being rehabilitated.
103.8 Use of Resource A. Resource A of the IEBC provides
guidelines  for  the  evaluation  of  fire-resistance  ratings  of
archaic materials and may be used in conjunction with reha-
bilitation projects.
103.9  Construction  documents.  Construction  documents
shall be submitted with the application for a permit. The work
proposed to be performed on an existing building or structure
shall  be  classified  on  the  construction  documents  as  repairs,
alterations, change of occupancy, addition, historic building,
or moved building.  Alterations  shall  further  be  classified  as
Level 1 or Level 2. Any required elevation certificate shall be
prepared  by  a  certified  land  surveyor  or  registered  profes-
sional civil engineer licensed in Virginia.
Exception: Construction  documents  or  classification  of
the work does not need to be submitted when the building
official  determines  the  proposed  work  does  not  require
such documents, classification or identification.

sustained substantial structural damage to the vertical
elements of its lateral force-resisting system shall be evalu-
ated in accordance with Section 502.3.1 and either repaired
in accordance with Section 502.3.2 or repaired and rehabili-
tated in accordance with Section 502.3.3, depending on the
results of the evaluation.
Exceptions:
1.Buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category A,
B,  or  C  whose  substantial  structural  damage  was
not caused by earthquake need not be evaluated or
rehabilitated  for  load  combinations  that  include
earthquake effects.
2.One-family and two-family dwellings need not be
evaluated  or  rehabilitated  for  load  combinations
that include earthquake effects.
502.3.1 Evaluation. The building shall be evaluated by a
registered  design  professional,  and  the  evaluation  find-
ings  shall  be  submitted  to  the  building  official.  The
evaluation  shall  establish  whether  the  damaged  building
if repaired to its predamage state, would comply with the
provisions of the VCC for load combinations that include
wind or earthquake effects, except that the seismic forces
shall be the reduced VCC-level seismic forces.
Wind   loads   for   this   evaluation   shall   be   those
prescribed in Section 1609 of the VCC. Earthquake loads
for this evaluation, if required, shall be permitted to be 75
percent of those prescribed in Section 1613 of the VCC.

evaluation  establishes  that  the  building  in  its  predamage
condition   complies   with   the   provisions   of   Section
502.3.1,  then  repairs  shall  be  permitted  that  restore  the
building to its predamage state.
502.3.3 Extent of repair for noncompliant buildings. If
the  evaluation  does  not  establish  that  the  building  in  its
predamage  condition  complies  with  the  provisions  of
Section 502.3.1, then the building shall be rehabilitated to
comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  section.  The  wind
loads  for  the  repair  shall  be  as  required  by  the  building
code in effect at the time of original construction, unless
the damage was caused by wind, in which case the wind
loads  shall  be  in  accordance  with  the  VCC.  The  earth-
quake  loads  for  this  rehabilitation  design  shall  be  those
required by the building code in effect at the time of orig-
inal construction, but not less than the reduced VCC-level
seismic forces. New structural members and connections
required  by  this  rehabilitation  design  shall  comply  with
the detailing provisions of the VCC for new buildings of
similar structure,  purpose  and  location.  Alternatively,
compliance with ASCE 41, using the performance objec-

EVALUATION PROCESS
1402.1  Evaluation  process.  The  evaluation  process  speci-
fied  herein  shall  be  followed  in  its  entirety  to  evaluate
existing  buildings  for  work  covered  by  this  chapter.  The
existing  building  shall  be  evaluated  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of this section and Sections 1403 and 1404. The
evaluation   shall   be   comprised   of   three   categories   as
described in Sections 1402.1.1 through 1402.1.3.
1402.1.1 Fire safety. Included within the fire safety cate-
gory  are  the  structural  fire  resistance,  automatic  fire
detection, fire alarm, automatic sprinkler system, and fire
suppression system features of the facility.
1402.1.2 Means of egress. Included within the means of
egress category are the configuration, characteristics, and
support features for means of egress in the facility.
1402.1.3  General  safety.  Included  within  the  general
safety  category  are  the  fire  safety  parameters  and  the
means-of-egress parameters.
1402.2 Occupancy basis. The evaluation of the building per
this chapter shall be based on the new occupancy. A partial
building change  of  occupancy  shall  be  evaluated  in  accor-
dance with Section 1402.2.1 or 1402.2.2 as applicable.
1402.2.1  Separated  change  of  occupancy.  Where  a
portion of the building undergoes a change of occupancy
and  that  portion  is  separated  from  the  remainder  of  the
building in accordance with Section 508.4 of the Virginia
Construction  Code  (VCC),  only  the  portion  of  building
undergoing the change of occupancy shall conform to the
provisions  of  this  chapter  based  on  the  new  occupancy
classification.
1402.2.2  Nonseparated  change  of  occupancy. Where a
portion of the building undergoes a change of occupancy
and that portion is not separated from the remainder of the
building in  accordance  with  Section  508.4  of  the  VCC,
the  provisions  of  this  chapter  shall  apply  to  the  entire
building based on all the occupancy classifications in the
building. 
1402.3 Structural evaluation. The existing building shall be
evaluated  to  determine  adequacy  of  the  existing  structural
systems for the proposed change of occupancy. The evalua-
tion  shall  demonstrate  that  the  
existing  building  with  the
work completed is capable of resisting the loads specified in
Chapter 16 of the VCC.
1402.4 Submittal. The results of the evaluation as required
in  Section  1402.1  shall  be  submitted  to  the  code  official.
Table 1404.1 shall be utilized for tabulating the results of the
evaluation. References to other sections of this code indicate
that  compliance  with  those  sections  is  required  in  order  to
gain credit in the evaluation herein outlined.
SECTION 1403
EVALUATION DATA
1403.1  Building  height  and  number  of  stories.  The  value
for building height and number of stories shall be the lesser
value   determined   by   the   formula   in   Section   1403.1.1.
Section 504 of the VCC shall be used to determine the allow-
able  height  and  number  of  stories  of  the  building.  Subtract
the  actual  building  height  from  the  allowable  height  and
divide by 12
1
/
2
 feet (3810 mm). Enter the height value and its
sign  (positive  or  negative)  in  Table  1404.1  under  Safety
Parameter 1403.1, Building Height, for fire safety, means of
egress, and general safety. The maximum score for a build-
ing shall be 10.
1403.1.1  Height  formula.  The  following  formulas  shall
be used in computing the building height value:
     
(Equation 14-1)
Note: Where  mixed  occupancies  are  separated  and
individually    evaluated    as    indicated    in    Section
1404.3.1,  the  values  AH, AS, EBH,  and  EBS  shall  be
based on the height of the occupancy being evaluated.
Height value, stories = (AS – EBS) × CF
(Equation 14-2)
AH=  Allowable  height  in  feet  (mm)  from  Section
504 of the VCC.
EBH=Existing building height in feet (mm).
AS=  Allowable  height  in  stories  from  Section  504

SECTION A101
PURPOSE
[BS]  A101.1  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to
promote  public  safety  and  welfare  by  reducing  the  risk  of
death  or  injury  from  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on  existing
unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings.
The  provisions  of  this  chapter  are  intended  as  minimum
standards  for  structural  seismic  resistance,  and  are  estab-
lished  primarily  to  reduce  the  risk  of  life  loss  or  injury.
Compliance   with   these   provisions   will   not   necessarily
prevent loss of life or injury, or prevent earthquake damage
to retrofitted buildings.

A112.4.2.
[BS]   A112.4.2   Moment-resisting   frames.   Moment
resisting  frames  shall  not  be  used  with  an  unreinforced
masonry wall in a single line of resistance unless the wall
has  piers  that  have  adequate  shear  capacity  to  sustain
rocking in accordance with Section A112.2.2. The frames
shall be designed in accordance with the building code to
resist  100  percent  of  the  seismic  forces  tributary  to  that
line  of  resistance,  as  determined  from  Section  A111.2.
The story drift ratio shall be limited to 0.0075.
SECTION A113
DETAILED BUILDING SYSTEM DESIGN 
REQUIREMENTS
[BS] A113.1 Wall anchorage.
[BS] A113.1.1 Anchor locations. Unreinforced masonry
walls  shall  be  anchored  at  the  roof  and  floor  levels  as
required in Section A110.2. Ceilings of plaster or similar
materials,  where  not  attached  directly  to  roof  or  floor
framing and where abutting masonry walls, shall either be
anchored  to  the  walls  at  a  maximum  spacing  of  6  feet
(1829 mm) or be removed.
[BS]  A113.1.2  Anchor  requirements.  Anchors  shall
consist of bolts installed through the wall as specified in
Table  A108.1(2),  or  an  approved  equivalent  at  a  maxi-
mum anchor spacing of 6 feet (1829 mm). Wall anchors
shall  be  secured  to  the  framing  members  parallel  or
perpendicular to the wall to develop the required forces.
[BS] A113.1.3 Minimum wall anchorage. Anchorage of
masonry  walls  to  each  floor  or  roof  shall  resist  a  mini-
mum  force  determined  as  0.9S
DS
   times   the   tributary
weight or 200 pounds per linear foot (2920 N/m), which-
ever is greater, acting normal to the wall at the level of the
floor  or  roof.  Existing  wall  anchors,  if  used,  must  be
tested and meet the requirements of Section A107.5.1 or
be upgraded.
[BS] A113.1.4 Anchors at corners. At the roof and floor
levels,  both  shear  and  tension  anchors  shall  be  provided
within 2 feet (610 mm) horizontally from the inside of the
corners of the walls.
[BS] A113.2 Diaphragm shear transfer. Anchors transmit-
ting  shear  forces  shall  have  a  maximum  spacing  of  6  feet
(1829 mm) and shall have nuts installed over malleable iron
or  plate  washers  where  bearing  on  wood,  and  heavy-cut
washers where bearing on steel.
[BS]   A113.3   Collectors.   Collector   elements   shall   be
provided  that  are  capable  of  transferring  the  seismic  forces
originating  in  other  portions  of  the  building  to  the  element
providing the resistance to those forces.

conform to the requirements of the building code.
[BS] A113.5 Wall bracing.
[BS]  A113.5.1  General.  Where  a  wall  height-to-thick-
ness  ratio  exceeds  the  specified  limits,  the  wall  may  be
laterally   supported   by   vertical   bracing   members   per
Section A113.5.2 or by reducing the wall height by brac-
ing per Section A113.5.3.
[BS]   A113.5.2   Vertical   bracing   members.   Vertical
bracing  members  shall  be  attached  to  floor  and  roof
construction   for   their   design   loads   independently   of
required  wall  anchors.  Horizontal  spacing  of  vertical
bracing members shall not exceed one-half of the unsup-
ported height of the wall or 10 feet (3048 mm). Deflection
of such bracing members at design loads shall not exceed
one-tenth of the wall thickness.
[BS]  A113.5.3  Intermediate  wall  bracing.  The  wall
height may be reduced by bracing elements connected to
the  floor  or  roof.  Horizontal  spacing  of  the  bracing
elements and wall anchors shall be as required by design,

capable  of  resisting  75  percent  of  the  forces  specified  in
Section 12.11.2.1 of ASCE 7.
Exceptions:
1.Existing walls need not be evaluated or retrofitted
for bending between anchors.
2.Work  required  by  this  chapter  need  not  consider
shrinkage,    thermal    changes    or    differential
settlement.
A206.1.1 Seismicity parameters, site class and geologic
hazards.  For  any  site  designated  as  Site  Class  E,  the
value of F
a
 shall be taken as 1.2. Site-specific procedures
are not required for compliance with this chapter. Mitiga-
tion  of  existing  geologic  site  hazards  such  as  liquefiable
soil, fault rupture or landslide is not required for compli-
ance with this chapter.
[BS]  A206.2  Additional  requirements  for  wall  anchorage
systems.
 The  wall  anchorage  system  shall  comply  with  the
requirements of this section and Section 12.11.2.2 of ASCE 7.
The  maximum  spacing  between  wall  anchors  shall  be  8
feet  (2438  mm),  and  each  wall  segment  shall  have  at  least
two wall anchors.
The  wall  anchorage  system,  excluding  subdiaphragms
and   existing   roof   or   floor   framing   members,   shall   be
designed   and   installed   to   limit   the   relative   movement
between the wall and the diaphragm to no more than 
1
/
8
 inch
before  engagement  of  the  anchors.  Wall  anchors  shall  be
provided to resist out-of-plane forces, independent of exist-
ing shear anchors.
Where new members are added as crossties, they shall be
spaced no more than 24 feet (7315 mm) apart. Where exist-
ing girders are used as crossties, their actual spacing shall be
deemed  adequate  even  where  the  spacing  exceeds  24  feet
(7315 mm), as long as the girders are provided with continu-
ity connectors as required.
Wall  anchorage  shall  not  be  provided  by  fastening  the
edge of plywood sheathing to steel ledgers. Wall anchorage
shall  not  be  provided  solely  by  fastening  the  edge  of  steel
decking to steel ledgers unless analysis demonstrates accept-
able  capacity.  The  existing  connections  shall  be  subject  to
field verification and the new connections shall be subject to
special inspection.
New wall anchors shall be provided to resist the full wall
anchorage  design  force  independent  of  existing  shear  or
tension anchors.
Exception:   Existing   cast-in-place   anchors   shall   be
permitted as part of the  wall  anchorage  system  if  the  tie
element can be readily attached to the anchors, and if the
anchors  are  capable  of  resisting  the  total  vertical  and
lateral shear load (including dead load) while being acted
on by the maximum wall anchorage tension force caused
by an earthquake. Acceptable tension values for the exist-
ing anchors  shall  be  established by testing in accordance
with Section A205.4.

capacity  to  develop  into  the  diaphragm  a  force  equal  to  the
lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the reentrant wall or
the  tributary  shear  based  on  75  percent  of  the  diaphragm
design  forces  specified  in  Section  12.10  of  ASCE  7.  The
capacity of the collector need not exceed the capacity of the
diaphragm  to  deliver  loads  to  the  collector.  A  connection
shall be provided from the collector to the reentrant wall to
transfer  the  full  collector  internal  force.  If  a  truss  or  beam
other than a rafter or purlin is supported by the reentrant wall
or by a column integral with the reentrant wall, then an inde-
pendent secondary column is required to support the roof or
floor  members  whenever  rocking  or  shear  capacity  of  the
reentrant wall is less than the tributary shear.
[BS] A206.8  Mezzanines.  Existing  mezzanines  relying  on
reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry walls for vertical
or lateral support shall be anchored to the walls for the tribu-
tary mezzanine load. Walls depending on the mezzanine for

PRESCRIPTIVE PROVISIONS FOR SEISMIC STRENGTHENING 
OF CRIPPLE WALLS AND SILL PLATE ANCHORAGE OF 
LIGHT, WOOD-FRAME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
SECTION A301
GENERAL
[BS]  A301.1  Purpose.  The  provisions  of  this  chapter  are
intended  to  promote  public  safety  and  welfare  by  reducing
the  risk  of  earthquake-induced  damage  to  existing  wood-
frame  residential  buildings.  The  requirements  contained  in
this chapter are prescriptive minimum standards intended to
improve  the  seismic  performance  of  residential  buildings;
however,   they   will   not   necessarily   prevent   earthquake
damage.
This chapter sets standards for strengthening that may be
approved  by  the  code  official  without  requiring  plans  or
calculations  prepared  by  a  registered  design  professional.
The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the
use of any material or method of construction not prescribed
herein. The code official may require that construction docu-
ments   for   strengthening   using   alternative   materials   or
methods be prepared by a registered design professional.
[BS] A301.2 Scope. The provisions of this chapter apply to
residential   buildings   of   light-frame   wood   construction
containing  one  or  more  of  the  structural  weaknesses  speci-
fied in Section A303.
Exception: The provisions of this chapter do not apply to
the buildings, or elements thereof, listed as follows. These
buildings  or  elements  require  analysis  by  a  registered
design professional in accordance with Section A301.3 to
determine appropriate strengthening:
1.Group R-1.
2.Group R with more than four dwelling units.
3.Buildings  with  a  lateral  force-resisting  system
using poles or columns embedded in the ground.
4.Cripple  walls  that  exceed  4  feet  (1219  mm)  in
height.
5.Buildings  exceeding  three  stories  in  height  and
any  three-story  building  with  cripple  wall  studs
exceeding 14 inches (356 mm) in height.

conditions  exist  that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the
prescriptive requirements of this chapter.
7.Buildings   or   portions   thereof   constructed   on
concrete slabs on grade.
[BS]  A301.3  Alternative  design  procedures.  The  details
and prescriptive provisions herein are not intended to be the
only  acceptable  strengthening  methods  permitted.  Alterna-
tive details and methods shall be permitted to be used where
approved by the code official. Approval of alternatives shall

SECTION A303
STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES
[BS] A303.1 General. For the purposes of this chapter, any
of  the  following  conditions  shall  be  deemed  a  structural
weakness:
1.Sill plates or floor framing that are supported directly
on  the  ground  without  a  foundation  system  that
conforms to the building code.
2.A  perimeter  foundation  system  that  is  constructed
only   of   wood   posts   supported   on   isolated   pad
footings.
3.Perimeter     foundation     systems     that     are     not
continuous.
Exceptions:
1.Existing   single-story   exterior   walls   not
exceeding  10  feet  (3048  mm)  in  length,
forming an extension of floor area beyond
the line of an existing continuous perime-
ter foundation.
2.Porches, storage rooms and similar spaces
not containing fuel-burning appliances.
4.A perimeter foundation system that is constructed of
unreinforced masonry or stone.
5.Sill plates that are not connected to the foundation or
that are connected with less than what is required by
the building code.
Exception: Where approved by the code official,
connections of a sill plate to the foundation made
with  other  than  sill  bolts  shall  be  accepted  if  the
capacity  of  the  connection  is  equivalent  to  that
required by the building code.
6.Cripple walls that are not braced in accordance with
the   requirements   of   Section   A304.4   and   Table
A304.3.1,  or  cripple  walls  not  braced  with  diagonal

with the building code.
SECTION A304
STRENGTHENING REQUIREMENTS
[BS] A304.1 General.
[BS] A304.1.1 Scope. The structural weaknesses noted in
Section  A303  shall  be  strengthened  in  accordance  with
the requirements of this section. Strengthening work may
include  both  new  construction  and  alteration  of  existing
construction. Except as provided herein, all strengthening
work  and  materials  shall  comply  with  the  applicable
provisions of the International Building Code.
[BS]  A304.1.2  Condition  of  existing  wood  materials.
Existing wood materials that will be a part of the strength-
ening work (such as sills, studs and sheathing) shall be in
a sound condition and free from defects that substantially
reduce  the  capacity  of  the  member.  Any  wood  material
found  to  contain  fungus  infection  shall  be  removed  and
replaced with new material. Any wood material found to
be  infested  with  insects  or  to  have  been  infested  with
insects shall be strengthened or replaced with new materi-
als to provide a net dimension of sound wood equal to or
greater than its undamaged original dimension.
[BS] A304.1.3 Floor joists not parallel to foundations.
Floor joists framed perpendicular or at an angle to perim-
eter  foundations  shall  be  restrained  either  by  an  existing
nominal 2-inch-wide (51 mm) continuous rim joist or by
a nominal 2-inch-wide (51 mm) full-depth block between
alternate  joists  in  one-  and  two-story  buildings,  and
between   each   joist   in   three-story  buildings.  Existing
blocking  for  multiple-story  buildings  must  occur  at  each
joist space above a braced cripple wall panel.
Existing connections at the top and bottom edges of an
existing rim joist or blocking need not be verified in one
story  buildings.  In  multiple-story  buildings,  the  existing
top  edge  connection  need  not  be  verified;  however,  the
bottom edge connection to either the foundation sill plate
or  the  top  plate  of  a  cripple  wall  shall  be  verified.  The
minimum  existing  bottom  edge  connection  shall  consist
of  8d  toenails  spaced  6  inches  (152  mm)  apart  for  a
continuous  rim  joist,  or  three  8d  toenails  per  block.
Where this minimum bottom edge-connection is not pres-
ent  or  cannot  be  verified,  a  supplemental  connection
installed  as  shown  in  Figure  A304.1.3  or  A304.1.4(2)
shall be provided.
Where  an  existing  continuous  rim  joist  or  the  mini-
mum existing blocking does not occur, new

[BS]  A304.1.4  Floor  joists  parallel  to  foundations.
Where  existing  floor  joists  are  parallel  to  the  perimeter
foundations, the end joist shall be located over the foun-
dation and, except for required ventilation openings, shall
be continuous and in continuous contact with the founda-
tion sill plate or the top plate of the cripple wall. Existing
connections  at  the  top  and  bottom  edges  of  the  end  joist
need  not  be  verified  in  one-story  buildings.  In  multiple-
story  buildings,  the  existing  top  edge  connection  of  the
end joist need not be verified; however, the bottom edge
connection  to  either  the  foundation  sill  plate  or  the  top
plate  of  a  cripple  wall  shall  be  verified.  The  minimum
bottom  edge  connection  shall  be  8d  toenails  spaced  6
inches  (152  mm)  apart.  If  this  minimum  bottom  edge
connection is not present or cannot be verified, a supple-
mental    connection    installed    as    shown    in    Figure

materials are installed on the interior face of studs form-
ing  an  enclosed  space  between  the  new  bracing  and  the
existing  exterior  finish,  each  braced  stud  space  must  be
ventilated.  Adequate  ventilation  and  access  for  future
inspection  shall  be  provided  by  drilling  one  2-inch  to  3-
inch-diameter (51 mm to 76 mm) round hole through the
sheathing,  nearly  centered  between  each  stud  at  the  top
and  bottom  of  the  cripple  wall.  Such  holes  should  be
spaced not less than 1 inch (25 mm) clear from the sill or
top  plates.  In  stud  spaces  containing  sill  bolts,  the  hole
shall  be  located  on  the  centerline  of  the  sill  bolt  but  not
closer than 1 inch (25 mm) clear from the nailing edge of
the sheathing. Where existing blocking occurs within the
stud  space,  additional  ventilation  holes  shall  be  placed
above and below the blocking, or the existing block shall
be removed and a new nominal 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm
by  102  mm)  block  shall  be  installed  with  the  nominal  4-
inch   (102   mm)   dimension   against   the   face   of   the
plywood. For stud heights less than 18 inches (457 mm),
only one ventilation hole need be provided.
[BS] A304.4.4 Existing underfloor ventilation. Existing
underfloor   ventilation   shall   not   be   reduced   without
providing equivalent new ventilation as close to the exist-
ing  ventilation  as  possible.  Braced  panels  may  include
underfloor  ventilation  openings  where  the  height  of  the
opening, measured from the top of the foundation wall to
the top of the opening, does not exceed 25 percent of the
height of the cripple stud wall; however, the length of the
panel shall be increased a distance equal to the length of
the opening or one stud space minimum. Where an open-
ing exceeds 25 percent of the cripple wall height, braced
panels shall not be located where the opening occurs. See
Figure A304.4.1(3).

CHAPTER A4
EARTHQUAKE RISK REDUCTION IN WOOD-FRAME RESIDENTIAL 
BUILDINGS WITH SOFT, WEAK OR OPEN FRONT WALLS
SECTION A401
GENERAL
[BS]  A401.1  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to
promote  public  welfare  and  safety  by  reducing  the  risk  of
death  or  injury  as  a  result  of  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on
existing   wood-frame,   multiple-unit   residential   buildings.
The ground motions of past earthquakes have caused the loss
of human life, personal injury and property damage in these
types of buildings. This chapter creates minimum standards
to  strengthen  the  more  vulnerable  portions  of  these  struc-
tures.  Where  fully  followed,  these  minimum  standards  will
improve  the  performance  of  these  buildings  but  will  not
necessarily prevent all earthquake-related damage.
[BS] A401.2 Scope. The provisions of this chapter apply to
existing buildings of wood construction that contain residen-
tial  occupancies  and  are  assigned  to  Risk  Category  II,  and
where the structure has a soft, weak or open-front wall line,
and there exists one or more stories above.
SECTION A402
DEFINITIONS
[BS]  A402.1  Definitions.  Notwithstanding  the  applicable
definitions,  symbols  and  notations  in  the  building  code,  the
following  definitions  shall  apply  for  the  purposes  of  this
chapter:
[BS] ASPECT RATIO. The span-width ratio for horizontal
diaphragms and the height-length ratio for shear walls.
[BS]  NONCONFORMING  STRUCTURAL  MATERI-
ALS.  Wall  bracing  materials  other  than  wood  structural
panels or diagonal sheathing.
[BS]  OPEN-FRONT  WALL  LINE. An exterior wall line,
without   vertical   elements   of   the   lateral   force-resisting
system,  that  requires  tributary  seismic  forces  to  be  resisted
by diaphragm rotation or excessive cantilever beyond paral-
lel  lines  of  shear  walls.  Diaphragms  that  cantilever  more
than 25 percent of the distance between lines of lateral force-
resisting  elements  from  which  the  diaphragm  cantilevers
shall  be  considered  to  be  excessive.  Exterior  exit  balconies
of 6 feet (1829 mm) or less in width shall not be considered
excessive cantilevers.
[BS]  RETROFIT.  An  improvement  of  the  lateral  force-
resisting system by alteration of existing structural elements
or addition of new structural elements.
[BS]  SOFT  WALL  LINE.  A  wall  line  whose  lateral  stiff-
ness  is  less  than  that  required  by  story  drift  limitations  or
deformation  compatibility  requirements  of  this  chapter.  In
lieu of analysis, a soft wall line may be defined as a wall line
in a story where the story stiffness is less than 70 percent of
the story above for the direction under consideration.
[BS]  STORY.  A  story  as  defined  by  the  building  code,
including  any  basement  or  underfloor  space  of  a  building
with cripple walls exceeding 4 feet (1219 mm) in height.
[BS]  WALL  LINE.  Any  length  of  wall  along  a  principal
axis  of  the  building  used  to  provide  resistance  to  lateral
loads. Parallel wall lines separated by less than 4 feet (1219
mm) shall be considered to be one wall line for the distribu-
tion of loads.
[BS] WEAK WALL LINE. A wall line in a story where the
story strength is less than 80 percent of the story above in the
direction under consideration.
SECTION A403
ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
[BS] A403.1 General. Modifications required by the provi-
sions in this chapter shall be designed in accordance with the
International  Building  Code  provisions  for  new  construc-
tion, except as modified by this chapter.
Exception:    Buildings    for    which    the    prescriptive
measures provided in Section A404 apply and are used.
Alteration of the existing lateral force-resisting system or
vertical load-carrying system shall not reduce the strength or
stiffness of the existing structure, unless the altered structure
would remain in conformance to the building code and this
chapter.
[BS]  A403.2  Scope  of  analysis.  This  chapter  requires  the
alteration,   repair,  replacement  or  addition  of  structural
elements and their connections to meet the strength and stiff-
ness requirements herein. The lateral load-path analysis shall
include  the  resisting  elements  and  connections  from  the
wood diaphragm immediately above any soft, weak or open-
front  wall  lines  to  the  foundation  soil  interface  or  to  the
uppermost  story  of  a  podium  structure  comprised  of  steel,
masonry,  or  concrete  structural  systems  that  supports  the
upper  wood-framed  structure.  Stories  above  the  uppermost
story  with  a  soft,  weak  or  open-front  wall  line  shall  be
considered  in  the  analysis  but  need  not  be  modified.  The
lateral load-path analysis for added structural elements shall
include  evaluation  of  the  allowable  soil-bearing  and  lateral
pressures  in  accordance  with  the  building  code.  Where  any
portion  of  a  building  within  the  scope  of  this  chapter  is
constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical
in three units horizontal (33-percent slope), the lateral force-
resisting system at and below the base level diaphragm shall
be  analyzed  for  the  effects  of  concentrated  lateral  forces  at
the base caused by this hillside condition.

[BS]  A403.3  Design  base  shear  and  design  parameters.
The design base shear in a given direction shall be permitted
to  be  75  percent  of  the  value  required  for  similar  new
construction in accordance with the building code. The value
of R used in the design of the strengthening of any story shall
not exceed the lowest value of R used in the same direction
at any story above. The system overstrength factor, Ω
0
, and
the deflection amplification factor, C
d
, shall be not less than
the  largest  respective  value  corresponding  to  the  R  factor
being used in the direction under consideration.
Exceptions:
1.For  structures  assigned  to  Seismic  Design  Cate-
gory B, values of R, Ω
0
 and C
d
 shall be permitted
to  be  based  on  the  seismic  force-resisting  system
being used to achieve the required strengthening.
2.For  structures  assigned  to  Seismic  Design  Cate-
gory  C  or  D,  values  of  R, Ω
0
  and  C
d
  shall  be
permitted to be based on the seismic force-resist-
ing  system  being  used  to  achieve  the  required
strengthening, provided that when the strengthen-
ing is complete, the strengthened structure will not
have an extreme weak story irregularity defined as
Type 5b in ASCE 7, Table 12.3-2.
3.For  structures  assigned  to  Seismic  Design  Cate-
gory E, values of R, Ω
0
 and C
d
 shall be permitted
to  be  based  on  the  seismic  force-resisting  system
being  used  to  achieve  the  required  strengthening,
provided that when the strengthening is complete,
the   strengthened   structure   will   not   have   an
extreme  soft  story,  a  weak  story,  or  an  extreme
weak  story  irregularity  defined,  respectively,  as
Types 1b, 5a and 5b in ASCE 7, Table 12.3-2.
4.For  retrofit  systems  involving  different  seismic
force-resisting   systems   in   the   same   direction
within   the   same   story,   resisting   elements   are
permitted to be designed using the least value of R
for  the  different  structural  systems  found  in  each
independent line of resistance if all of the follow-
ing conditions are met:
4.1.   The building is assigned to Risk Category
I or II.
4.2.   The  building  height  is  no  more  than  four
stories above grade plane.
4.3.   The seismic force-resisting systems of the
retrofitted  building  comprise  only  wood
structural panel shear walls, steel moment-
resisting  frames,  steel  cantilever  columns
and steel-braced frames. Values for C and
Ω
0
  shall  be  consistent  with  the  R  value
used.
5.With reference to ASCE 7, Table 12.2-1, ordinary,
intermediate  and  special  steel  systems,  and  all
light-frame  systems  shall  be  permitted  without
limitation  where  those  systems  are  used  only  for
retrofit  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  this
chapter.
[BS]  A403.3.1  Expected  story  strength.  Despite  any
other requirement of Section A403.3 or A403.4, the total
expected strength of retrofit elements added to any story
need  not  exceed  1.7  times  the  expected  strength  of  the
story  immediately  above  in  a  two-story  building,  or  1.3
times  the  expected  strength  of  the  story  immediately
above  in  a  three-story  or  taller  building,  as  long  as  the
retrofit  elements  are  located  symmetrically  about  the
center  of  mass  of  the  story  above,  or  so  as  to  minimize
torsion  in  the  retrofitted  story.  Calculation  of  expected
story   strength   and   identification   of   irregularities   in
Section A403.3 shall be based on the expected strength of
all wall lines, even if sheathed with nonconforming mate-
rials. The strength of a wall line above the retrofitted story
shall be permitted to be reduced to account for inadequate
load path or overturning resistance.
[BS]  A403.3.2  Seismicity  parameters,  site  class  and
geologic hazards. For any site designated as Site Class E,
the  value  of  F  shall  be  taken  as  1.2.  Site-specific  proce-
dures  are  not  required  for  compliance  with  this  chapter.
Mitigation of existing geologic site hazards such as lique-
fiable  soil,  fault  rupture  or  landslide  is  not  required  for
compliance with this chapter.
[BS]  A403.4  Story  drift  limitations.  The  calculated  story
drift for each retrofitted story shall not exceed the allowable
deformation   compatible   with   all   vertical   load-resisting
elements  and  0.025  times  the  story  height.  The  calculated
story  drift  shall  not  be  reduced  by  the  effects  of  horizontal
diaphragm  stiffness  but  shall  be  increased  where  these
effects produce rotation. Drift calculations shall be in accor-
dance with the building code.
[BS]  A403.4.1  Pole  structures.  The  effects  of  rotation

SECTION C101
GENERAL
[BS]  C101.1  Purpose.  This  chapter  provides  prescriptive
methods for partial structural retrofit of an existing building
to  increase  its  resistance  to  out-of-plane  wind  loads.  It  is
intended  for  voluntary  use  and  for  reference  by  mitigation
programs. The provisions of this chapter do not necessarily
satisfy  requirements  for  new  construction.  Unless  specifi-
cally cited, the provisions of this chapter do not necessarily
satisfy  requirements  for  structural  improvements  triggered
by addition, alteration, repair, change of occupancy, build-
ing relocation or other circumstances.
[BS]  C101.2  Eligible  buildings  and  gable  end  walls.  The
provisions  of  this  chapter  are  applicable  only  to  buildings
that meet the following eligibility requirements:
1.The building is not more than three stories tall, from
adjacent grade to the bottom plate of each gable end
wall being retrofitted with this chapter.
2.The building is classified as Occupancy Group R3 or
is  within  the  scope  of  the  International  Residential
Code.
3.The  structure  includes  one  or  more  wood-framed
gable  end  walls,  either  conventionally  framed  or
metal-plate-connected.
In  addition,  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  are  applicable
only  to  gable  end  walls  that  meet  the  following  eligibility
requirements:
4.Each  gable  end  wall  has  or  shall  be  provided  with
studs or vertical webs spaced 24 inches (610 mm) on
center maximum.
5.Each gable end wall has a maximum height of 16 feet
(4877 mm).
[BS] C101.3 Compliance  Eligible  gable  end  walls  in  eligi-
ble  buildings  may  be  retrofitted  in  accordance  with  this
chapter.  Other  modifications  required  for  compliance  with
this chapter shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the International  Building  Code  or  International  Resi-
dential  Code  provisions  for  new  construction,  except  as
specifically provided for by this chapter.

GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF 
ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
User note:
About this resource: In the process of repair and alteration of existing buildings, based on the nature and the extent of the work, this code
might require certain upgrades in the fire-resistance rating of building elements, at which time it becomes critical for the designers and the
code officials to be able to determine the fire-resistance rating of the existing building elements as part of the overall evaluation for the assess-
ment of the need for improvements. This resource document provides a guideline for such an evaluation for fire-resistance rating of archaic
materials that is not typically found in the modern model building codes.
Introduction
The International Existing Building Code

 (IEBC

) is a comprehensive code with the goal of addressing all aspects of work
taking place in existing buildings and providing user-friendly methods and tools for regulation and improvement of such build-
ings. This resource document is included within the cover of the IEBC with that goal in mind and as a step towards accomplish-
ing that goal.
In the process of repair and alteration of existing buildings, based on the nature and the extent of the work, the IEBC might
require certain upgrades in the fire-resistance rating of building elements, at which time it becomes critical for the designers and
the code officials to be able to determine the fire-resistance rating of the existing building elements as part of the overall evalua-
tion for the assessment of the need for improvements. This resource document provides a guideline for such an evaluation for
fire-resistance ratings of archaic materials that are not typically found in the modern model building codes.
 Resource A is only a guideline and is not intended to be a document for specific adoption as it is not written in the format or
language of ICC’s International Codes and is not subject to the code development process.
 PURPOSE
The Guidelines on Fire Ratings of Archaic Materials and Assemblies focuses upon the fire-related performance of archaic
construction. “Archaic” encompasses construction typical of an earlier time, generally prior to 1950. “Fire-related performance”
includes fire resistance, flame spread, smoke production and degree of combustibility.
 The purpose of this guideline is to update the information which was available at the time of original construction, for use by
architects, engineers and code officials when evaluating the fire safety of a rehabilitation project. In addition, information rele-
vant to the evaluation of general classes of materials and types of construction is presented for those cases when documentation
of the fire performance of a particular archaic material or assembly cannot be found.
 It has been assumed that the building materials and their fastening, joining and incorporation into the building structure are
sound mechanically. Therefore, some determination must be made that the original manufacture, the original construction prac-
tice, and the rigors of aging and use have not weakened the building. This assessment can often be difficult because process and
quality control was not good in many industries, and variations among locally available raw materials and manufacturing tech-
niques often resulted in a product which varied widely in its strength and durability. The properties of iron and steel, for exam-
ple, varied widely, depending on the mill and the process used.
 There is nothing inherently inferior about archaic materials or construction techniques. The pressures that promote funda-
mental change are most often economic or technological matters not necessarily related to concerns for safety. The high cost of
labor made wood lath and plaster uneconomical. The high cost of land and the congestion of the cities provided the impetus for
high-rise construction. Improved technology made it possible. The difficulty with archaic materials is not a question of suitabil-
ity, but familiarity.
 Code requirements for the fire performance of key building elements (e.g., walls, floor/ceiling assemblies, doors, shaft enclo-
sures) are stated in performance terms: hours of fire resistance. It matters not whether these elements were built in 1908 or 1980,
only that they provide the required degree of fire resistance. The level of performance will be defined by the local community,
primarily through the enactment of a building or rehabilitation code. This guideline is only a tool to help evaluate the various
building elements, regardless of what the level of performance is required to be.
 The problem with archaic materials is simply that documentation of their fire performance is not readily available. The appli-
cation of engineering judgment is more difficult because building officials may not be familiar with the materials or construction
method involved. As a result, either a full-scale fire test is required or the archaic construction in question removed and replaced.
Both alternatives are time consuming and wasteful.

This   guideline   and   the   accompanying   appendix   are
designed  to  help  fill  this  information  void.  By  providing  the
necessary  documentation,  there  will  be  a  firm  basis  for  the
continued acceptance of archaic materials and assemblies.

FIRE-RELATED PERFORMANCE OF ARCHAIC 
MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
1.1
FIRE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 This guideline does not specify the level of performance
required for the various building components. These require-
ments are controlled by the building  occupancy  and  use  and
are set forth in the local building or rehabilitation code.
  The  fire  resistance  of  a  given  building  element  is  estab-
lished by subjecting a sample of the assembly to a “standard”
fire  test  which  follows  a  “standard”  time-temperature  curve.
This test method has changed little since the 1920s. The test
results  tabulated  in  the  Appendix  have  been  adjusted  to
reflect current test methods.
  The  current  model  building  codes  cite  other  fire-related
properties not always tested for in earlier years: flame spread,
smoke  production,  and  degree  of  combustibility.  However,
they can generally be assumed to fall within well defined val-
ues because the principal combustible component of archaic
materials  is  cellulose.  Smoke  production  is  more  important
today because of the increased use of plastics. However, the
early  flame  spread  tests,  developed  in  the  early  1940s,  also
included a test for smoke production.
“Plastics,” one of the most important classes of contempo-
rary materials, were not found in the review of archaic mate-
rials. If plastics are to be used in a rehabilitated building, they
should be evaluated by contemporary standards. Information
and documentation of their fire-related properties and perfor-
mance is widely available.
 Flame spread, smoke production and degree of combusti-
bility  are  discussed  in  detail  below.  Test  results  for  eight
common  species  of  lumber,  published  in  an  Underwriter’s
Laboratories’ report (104), are noted in the following table:
 TUNNEL TEST RESULTS FOR EIGHT SPECIES OF LUMBER  
Flame Spread
The  flame  spread  of  interior  finishes  is  most  often  mea-
sured  by  the  ASTM  E84  “tunnel  test.”  This  test  measures
how far and how fast the flames spread across the surface of
the  test  sample.  The  resulting  flame  spread  rating  (FSR)  is
expressed as a number on a continuous scale where cement-
asbestos  board  is  0  and  red  oak  is  100.  (Materials  with  a
flame  spread  greater  than  red  oak  have  an  FSR  greater  than
100.) The scale is divided into distinct groups or classes. The
most commonly used flame spread classifications are: Class I
or A*, with a 0
–25 FSR; Class II or B, with a 26–75 FSR; and
Class  III  or  C,  with  a  76
–200  FSR.  The  NFPA  Life  Safety
Code also  has  a  Class  D  (201
–500  FSR)  and  Class  E  (over
500 FSR) interior finish.
These classifications are typically used in modern building
codes  to  restrict  the  rate  of  fire  spread.  Only  the  first  three
classifications are normally permitted, though not all classes
of materials can be used in all places throughout a building.
For example, the interior finish of building materials used in
exits or in corridors leading to exits is more strictly regulated
than materials used within private dwelling units.
In general, inorganic archaic materials (e.g., bricks or tile)
can be expected to be in Class I. Materials of whole wood are
mostly Class II. Whole wood is defined as wood used in the
same  form  as  sawn  from  the  tree.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the
contemporary reconstituted wood products such as plywood,
fiberboard,   hardboard,   or   particle   board.   If   the   organic
archaic material is not whole wood, the flame spread classifi-
cation could be well over 200 and thus would be particularly
unsuited for use in exits and other critical locations in a build-
ing.  Some  plywoods  and  various  wood  fiberboards  have
flame  spreads  over  200.  Although  they  can  be  treated  with
fire retardants to reduce their flame spread, it would be advis-
able  to  assume  that  all  such  products  have  a  flame  spread
over 200 unless there is information to the contrary.
Smoke Production
The evaluation of smoke density is part of the ASTM E84
tunnel test. For the eight species of lumber shown in the table
above,  the  highest  levels  are  275–305  for  Yellow  Pine,  but
most of the others are less smoky than red oak which has an
index  of  100.  The  advent  of  plastics  caused  substantial
increases in the smoke density values measured by the tunnel
test. The ensuing limitation of the smoke production for wall
and ceiling materials by the model building codes has been a
reaction  to  the  introduction  of  plastic  materials.  In  general,
cellulosic materials fall in the 50–300 range of smoke density
which is below the general limitation of 450 adopted by many
codes.
Degree of Combustibility
The model building codes tend to define “noncombustibil-
ity” on the basis of having passed ASTM E136 or if the mate-
rial is totally inorganic. The acceptance of gypsum wallboard
as noncombustible is based on limiting paper thickness to not
over 
1

 inch and a 0–50 flame spread rating by ASTM E84.

At times there were provisions to define a Class I or A mate-
rial  (0–25  FSR)  as  noncombustible,  but  this  is  not  currently
recognized by most model building codes.
If there is any doubt whether or not an archaic material is
noncombustible, it would be appropriate to send out samples
for evaluation. If an archaic material is determined to be non-
combustible  according  to  ASTM  E136,  it  can  be  expected
that it will not contribute fuel to the fire.
1.2
COMBUSTIBLE CONSTRUCTION TYPES
One of the earliest forms of timber construction used exte-
rior load-bearing masonry walls with columns and/or wooden
walls supporting wooden beams and floors in the interior of
the building. This form of construction, often called “mill” or
“heavy  timber”  construction,  has  approximately  1  hour  fire
resistance.  The  exterior  walls  will  generally  contain  the  fire
within the building.
With the development of dimensional lumber, there was a
switch  from  heavy  timber  to  “balloon  frame”  construction.
The  balloon  frame  uses  load-bearing  exterior  wooden  walls
which have long timbers often extending from foundation to
roof.  When  longer  lumber  became  scarce,  another  form  of
construction, “platform” framing, replaced the balloon fram-
ing.  The  difference  between  the  two  systems  is  significant
because  platform  framing  is  automatically  fire-blocked  at
every  floor  while  balloon  framing  commonly  has  concealed
spaces  that  extend  unblocked  from  basement  to  attic.  The
architect,  engineer,  and  code  official  must  be  alert  to  the
details  of  construction  and  the  ease  with  which  fire  can
spread in concealed spaces.

BUILDING EVALUATION 
A given rehabilitation project will most likely go through
several  stages.  The  preliminary  evaluation  process  involves
the  designer  in  surveying  the  prospective  building.  The  fire
resistance of existing building materials and construction sys-
tems  is  identified;  potential  problems  are  noted  for  closer
study. The final evaluation phase includes: developing design
solutions to upgrade the fire resistance of building elements,
if necessary; preparing working drawings and specifications;
and the securing of the necessary code approvals.
2.1
PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
A preliminary evaluation should begin with a building sur-
vey to determine the existing materials, the general arrange-
ment of the structure and the use of the occupied spaces, and
the details of construction. The designer needs to know “what
is there” before a decision can be reached about what to keep
and  what  to  remove  during  the  rehabilitation  process.  This
preliminary  evaluation  should  be  as  detailed  as  necessary  to
make  initial  plans.  The  fire-related  properties  need  to  be
determined  from  the  applicable  building  or  rehabilitation
code, and the materials and assemblies existing in the build-
ing then need to be evaluated for these properties. Two work
sheets  are  shown  below  to  facilitate  the  preliminary  evalua-
tion.
Two possible sources of information helpful in the prelim-
inary evaluation are the original building plans and the build-
ing  code  in  effect  at  the  time  of  original  construction.  Plans
may  be  on  file  with  the  local  building  department  or  in  the
offices of the original designers (e.g., architect, engineer) or
their successors. If plans are available, the investigator should
verify that the building was actually constructed as called for
in  the  plans,  as  well  as  incorporate  any  later  alterations  or
changes to the building. Earlier editions of the local building
code should be on file with the building official. The code in
effect  at  the  time  of  construction  will  contain  fire  perfor-
mance  criteria.  While  this  is  no  guarantee  that  the  required
performance  was  actually  provided,  it  does  give  the  investi-
gator  some  guidance  as  to  the  level  of  performance  which
may   be   expected.   Under   some  code  administration  and
enforcement  systems,  the  code  in  effect  at  the  time  of  con-
struction  also  defines  the  level  of  performance  that  must  be
provided at the time of rehabilitation.
Figure 1 illustrates one method for organizing preliminary
field  notes.  Space  is  provided  for  the  materials,  dimensions,
and  condition  of  the  principal  building  elements.  Each  floor
of the structure should be visited and the appropriate informa-
tion obtained. In practice, there will often be identical materi-
als and construction on every floor, but the exception may be
of vital importance. A schematic diagram should be prepared
of  each  floor  showing  the  layout  of  exits  and  hallways  and
indicating where each element described in the field notes fits
into the structure as a whole. The exact arrangement of inte-
rior walls within apartments is of secondary importance from
a  fire  safety  point  of  view  and  need  not  be  shown  on  the
drawings  unless  these  walls  are  required  by  code  to  have  a
fire-resistance rating. 
The location of stairways and elevators should be clearly
marked  on  the  drawings.  All  exterior  means  of  escape  (e.g.,
fire escapes) should be identified.

The following notes explain the entries in Figure 1.
Exterior  Bearing  Walls
:  Many  old  buildings  utilize  heavily
constructed  walls  to  support  the  floor/ceiling  assemblies  at
the  exterior  of  the  building.  There  may  be  columns  and/or
interior  bearing  walls  within  the  structure,  but  the  exterior
walls are an important factor in assessing the fire safety of a
building.
The  field  investigator  should  note  how  the  floor/ceiling
assemblies  are  supported  at  the  exterior  of  the  building.  If
columns are incorporated in the exterior walls, the walls may
be considered nonbearing.
Interior  Bearing  Walls
:  It  may  be  difficult  to  determine
whether  or  not  an  interior  wall  is  load  bearing,  but  the  field
investigator  should  attempt  to  make  this  determination.  At  a
later  stage  of  the  rehabilitation  process,  this  question  will

RESOURCE A-42021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE
need  to  be  determined  exactly.  Therefore,  the  field  notes
should be as accurate as possible.
Exterior Nonbearing Walls
: The fire resistance of the exterior
walls is important for two reasons. These walls (both bearing
and  nonbearing)  are  depended  upon  to:  a)  contain  a  fire
within the building of origin; or b) keep an exterior fire out-
side the building. It is therefore important to indicate on the
drawings where any openings are located as well as the mate-
rials  and  construction  of  all  doors  or  shutters.  The  drawings
should indicate the presence of wired glass, its thickness and
framing,  and  identify  the  materials  used  for  windows  and
door frames. The protection of openings adjacent to exterior
means of escape (e.g., exterior stairways, fire escapes) is par-
ticularly  important.  The  ground  floor  drawing  should  locate
the building on the property and indicate the precise distances
to adjacent buildings.
Interior Nonbearing Walls (Partitions)
: A partition is a “wall
that extends from floor to ceiling and subdivides space within
any story of a building.” (48) Figure 1 has two categories (A
& B) for Interior Nonbearing Walls (Partitions) which can be
used for different walls, such as hallway walls as compared to
inter-apartment  walls.  Under  some  circumstances  there  may
be only one type of wall construction; in others, three or more
types of wall construction may occur.
The  field  investigator  should  be  alert  for  differences  in
function  as  well  as  in  materials  and  construction  details.  In
general, the details within apartments are not as important as
the major exit paths and exit stairways. The preliminary field
investigation should attempt to determine the thickness of all
walls. A term introduced below called “thickness design” will
depend  on  an  accurate  (±  
1
/
4
  inch)  determination.  Even
though  this  initial  field  survey  is  called  “preliminary,”  the
data generated should be as accurate and complete as possi-
ble.
The field investigator should note the exact location from
which  observations  are  recorded.  For  instance,  if  a  hole  is
found through a wall enclosing an exit stairway which allows
a  cataloguing  of  the  construction  details,  the  field  investiga-
tion notes should reflect the location of the “find.” At the pre-
liminary  stage  it  is  not  necessary  to  core  every  wall;  the
interior  details  of  construction  can  usually  be  determined  at
some location.
Structural Frame
: There may or may not be a complete skele-
tal  frame,  but  usually  there  are  columns,  beams,  trusses,  or
other like elements. The dimensions and spacing of the struc-
tural elements should be measured and indicated on the draw-
ings.  For  instance,  if  there  are  10-inch  square  columns
located on a 30-foot square grid throughout the building, this
should be noted. The structural material and cover or protec-
tive  materials  should  be  identified  wherever  possible.  The
thickness  of  the  cover  materials  should  be  determined  to  an
accuracy  of  ±  
1
/
4
  inch.  As  discussed  above,  the  preliminary
field survey usually relies on accidental openings in the cover
materials rather than a systematic coring technique.
Floor/Ceiling Structural Systems
: The span between supports
should be measured. If possible, a sketch of the cross-section
of  the  system  should  be  made.  If  there  is  no  location  where
accidental  damage  has  opened  the  floor/ceiling  construction
to visual inspection, it is necessary to make such an opening.
An evaluation of the fire resistance of a floor/ceiling assem-
bly  requires  detailed  knowledge  of  the  materials  and  their
arrangement. Special attention should be paid to the cover on
structural steel elements and the condition of suspended ceil-
ings and similar membranes.

RESOURCE A—GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODERESOURCE A-5
Roofs: The preliminary field survey of the roof system is ini-
tially  concerned  with  watertightness.  However,  once  it  is
apparent  that  the  roof  is  sound  for  ordinary  use  and  can  be
retained in the rehabilitated building, it becomes necessary to
evaluate  the  fire  performance.  The  field  investigator  must
measure  the  thickness  and  identify  the  types  of  materials
which  have  been  used.  Be  aware  that  there  may  be  several
layers of roof materials.
Doors
: Doors to stairways and hallways represent some of the
most important fire elements to be considered within a build-
ing.  The  uses  of  the  spaces  separated  largely  controls  the
level of fire performance necessary. Walls and doors enclos-
ing  stairways  or  elevator  shafts  would  normally  require  a
higher  level  of  performance  than  between  the  bedroom  and
bath. The various uses are differentiated in Figure 1.
Careful  measurements  of  the  thickness  of  door  panels
must be made, and the type of core material within each door
must  be  determined.  It  should  be  noted  whether  doors  have
self-closing   devices;   the   general   operation   of   the   doors
should  be  checked.  The  latch  should  engage  and  the  door
should fit tightly in the frame. The hinges should be in good
condition. If glass is used in the doors, it should be identified
as either plain glass or wired glass mounted in either a wood
or steel frame.
Materials
:  The  field  investigator  should  be  able  to  identify
ordinary building materials. In situations where an unfamiliar
material is found, a sample should be obtained. This sample
should  measure  at  least  10  cubic  inches  so  that  an  ASTM
E136 fire test can be conducted to determine if it is combusti-
ble.
Thickness
: The thickness of all materials should be measured
accurately since, under certain circumstances, the level of fire
resistance is very sensitive to the material thickness.
Condition
:  The  method  of  attaching  the  various  layers  and
facings to one another or to the supporting structural element
should be noted under the appropriate building element. The
“secureness”  of  the  attachment  and  the  general  condition  of
the layers and facings should be noted here.
Notes
: The “Notes” column can be used for many purposes,
but  it  might  be  a  good  idea  to  make  specific  references  to
other field notes or drawings.
After the building survey is completed, the data collected
must be analyzed. A suggested work sheet for organizing this
information is given below as Figure 2.
The  required  fire  resistance  and  flame  spread  for  each
building element are normally established by the local build-
ing or rehabilitation code. The fire performance of the exist-
ing materials and assemblies should then be estimated, using

one  of  the  techniques  described  below.  If  the  fire  perfor-
mance  of  the  existing  building  element(s)  is  equal  to  or
greater than that required, the materials and assemblies may
remain. If the fire performance is less than required, then cor-
rective measures must be taken.
The most common methods of upgrading the level of pro-
tection are to either remove and replace the existing building
element(s) or to repair and upgrade the existing materials and
assemblies. Other fire protection measures, such as automatic
sprinklers or detection and alarm systems, also could be con-
sidered, though they are beyond the scope of this guideline. If
the  upgraded  protection  is  still  less  than  that  required  or
deemed to be acceptable, additional corrective measures must
be taken. This process must continue until an acceptable level
of performance is obtained.
2.2
FIRE RESISTANCE OF EXISTING BUILDING 
ELEMENTS
The fire resistance of the existing building elements can be
estimated  from  the  tables  and  histograms  contained  in  the
Appendix. The Appendix is organized first by type of build-
ing element: walls, columns, floor/ceiling assemblies, beams,
and doors. Within each building element, the tables are orga-
nized  by  type  of  construction  (e.g.,  masonry,  metal,  wood
frame), and then further divided by minimum dimensions or
thickness of the building element.
A  histogram  precedes  every  table  that  has  10  or  more
entries. The X-axis measures fire resistance in hours; the Y-
axis shows the number of entries in that table having a given
level of fire resistance. The histograms also contain the loca-
tion of each entry within that table for easy cross-referencing.
The histograms, because they are keyed to the tables, can
speed   the   preliminary   investigation.  For  example,  Table
1.3.2, Wood Frame Walls 4" to Less Than 6" Thick, contains
96 entries. Rather than study each table entry, the histogram
shows that every wall assembly listed in that table has a fire
resistance of less than 2 hours. If the building code required
the wall to have 2 hours fire resistance, the designer, with a
minimum of effort, is made aware of a problem that requires
closer study.
Suppose the code had only required a wall of 1 hour fire
resistance.  The  histogram  shows  far  fewer  complying  ele-
ments  (19)  than  noncomplying  ones  (77).  If  the  existing
assembly  is  not  one  of  the  19  complying  entries,  there  is  a
strong possibility the existing assembly is deficient. The his-
tograms  can  also  be  used  in  the  converse  situation.  If  the
existing assembly is not one of the smaller number of entries
with  a  lower  than  required  fire  resistance,  there  is  a  strong
possibility the existing assembly will be acceptable.
At some point, the existing building component or assem-
bly  must  be  located  within  the  tables.  Otherwise,  the  fire
resistance must be determined through one of the other tech-
niques presented in the guideline. Locating the building com-
ponent  in  the  Appendix  Tables  not  only  guarantees  the
accuracy  of  the  fire-resistance  rating,  but  also  provides  a
source of documentation for the building official.
2.3
EFFECTS OF PENETRATIONS IN FIRE-RESISTANT 
ASSEMBLIES
There  are  often  many  features  in  existing  walls  or  floor/
ceiling  assemblies  which  were  not  included  in  the  original
certification or fire testing. The most common examples are
pipes and utility wires passed through holes poked through an
assembly. During the life of the building, many penetrations
are added, and by the time a building is ready for rehabilita-
tion  it  is  not  sufficient  to  just  consider  the  fire  resistance  of
the assembly as originally constructed. It is necessary to con-
sider all penetrations and their relative impact upon fire per-
formance. For instance, the fire resistance of the corridor wall
may be less important than the effect of plain glass doors or
transoms. In fact, doors are the most important single class of
penetrations.
A  fully  developed  fire  generates  substantial  quantities  of
heat and excess gaseous fuel capable of penetrating any holes
which might be present in the walls or ceiling of the fire com-
partment. In general, this leads to a severe degradation of the
fire  resistance  of  those  building  elements  and  to  a  greater
potential  for  fire  spread.  This  is  particularly  applicable  to
penetrations  located  high  in  a  compartment  where  the  posi-
tive pressure of the fire can force the unburned gases through
the penetration.
Penetrations  in  a  floor/ceiling  assembly  will  generally
completely  negate  the  barrier  qualities  of  the  assembly  and
will lead to rapid spread of fire to the space above. It will not
be a problem, however, if the penetrations are filled with non-
combustible materials strongly fastened to the structure. The
upper half of walls are similar to the floor/ceiling assembly in
that a positive pressure can reasonably be expected in the top
of  the  room,  and  this  will  push  hot  and/or  burning  gases
through the penetration unless it is completely sealed.
Building  codes  require  doors  installed  in  fire  resistive
walls  to  resist  the  passage  of  fire  for  a  specified  period  of
time. If the door to a fully involved room is not closed, a large
plume of fire will typically escape through the doorway, pre-
venting  anyone  from  using  the  space  outside  the  door  while
allowing  the  fire  to  spread.  This  is  why  door  closers  are  so
important.  Glass  in  doors  and  transoms  can  be  expected  to
rapidly  shatter  unless  constructed  of  listed  or  approved  wire
glass in a steel frame. As with other building elements, pene-
trations  or  nonrated  portions  of  doors  and  transoms  must  be
upgraded or otherwise protected.
Table 5.1 in Section V of the Appendix contains 41 entries
of  doors  mounted  in  sound  tight-fitting  frames.  Part  3.4
below  outlines  one  procedure  for  evaluating  and  possibly
upgrading existing doors.

FINAL EVALUATION AND DESIGN SOLUTION
The final evaluation begins after the rehabilitation project
has reached the final design stage and the choice is made to
keep certain archaic materials and assemblies in the rehabili-
tated  building.  The  final  evaluation  process  is  essentially  a
more refined and detailed version of the preliminary evalua-
tion.  The  specific  fire  resistance  and  flame  spread  require-

RESOURCE A—GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODERESOURCE A-7
ments are determined for the project. This may involve local
building  and  fire  officials  reviewing the preliminary evalua-
tion as depicted in Figures 1 and 2 and the field drawings and
notes. When necessary, provisions must be made to upgrade
existing building elements to provide the required level of fire
performance.
There are several approaches to design solutions that can
make  possible  the  continued  use  of  archaic  materials  and
assemblies  in  the  rehabilitated  structure.  The  simplest  case
occurs when the materials and assembly in question are found
within the Appendix Tables and the fire performance proper-
ties  satisfy  code  requirements.  Other  approaches  must  be
used,  though,  if  the  assembly  cannot  be  found  within  the
Appendix  or  the  fire  performance  needs  to  be  upgraded.
These approaches have been grouped into two classes: exper-
imental and theoretical.
3.1
THE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
If a material or assembly found in a building is not listed
in the Appendix Tables, there are several other ways to evalu-
ate fire performance. One approach  is  to  conduct  the  appro-
priate  fire  test(s)  and  thereby  determine  the  fire-related
properties directly. There are a number of laboratories in the
United  States  which  routinely  conduct  the  various  fire  tests.
A current list can be obtained by writing the Center for Fire
Research,  National  Bureau  of  Standards,  Washington,  D.C.
20234.
The contract with any of these testing laboratories should
require  their  observation  of  specimen  preparation  as  well  as
the testing of the specimen. A complete description of where
and  how  the  specimen  was  obtained  from  the  building,  the
transportation of the specimen, and its preparation for testing
should be noted in detail so that the building official can be
satisfied that the fire test is representative of the actual use.
The test report should describe the fire test procedure and
the response of the material or assembly. The laboratory usu-
ally submits a cover letter with the report to describe the pro-
visions  of  the  fire  test  that  were  satisfied  by  the  material  or
assembly under investigation. A building official will gener-
ally  require  this  cover  letter,  but  will  also  read  the  report  to
confirm that the material or assembly complies with the code
requirements.  Local  code  officials  should  be  involved  in  all
phases of the testing process.
The  experimental  approach  can  be  costly  and  time  con-
suming  because  specimens  must  be  taken  from  the  building
and transported to the testing laboratory. When a load bearing
assembly  has  continuous  reinforcement,  the  test  specimen
must be removed from the building, transported, and tested in
one  piece.  However,  when  the  fire  performance  cannot  be
determined by other means, there may be no alternative to a
full-scale test.
A  “nonstandard”  small-scale  test  can  be  used  in  special
cases.  Sample  sizes  need  only  be  10–25  square  feet  (0.93–
2.3  m
2
),  while  full-scale  tests  require  test  samples  of  either
100 or 180 square feet (9.3 or 17 m
2
) in size. This small-scale
test  is  best  suited  for  testing  nonload-bearing  assemblies
against thermal transmission only.
3.2
THE THEORETICAL APPROACH
There will be instances when materials and assemblies in a
building  undergoing  rehabilitation  cannot  be  found  in  the
Appendix  Tables.  Even  where  test  results  are  available  for
more  or  less  similar  construction,  the  proper  classification
may not be immediately apparent. Variations in dimensions,
loading conditions, materials, or workmanship may markedly
affect  the  performance  of  the  individual  building  elements,
and  the  extent  of  such  a  possible  effect  cannot  be  evaluated
from the tables.
Theoretical  methods  being  developed  offer  an  alternative
to the full-scale fire tests discussed above. For example, Sec-
tion  4302(b)  of  the  1979  edition  of  the  Uniform  Building
Code specifically allows an engineering design for fire resis-
tance in lieu of conducting full-scale tests. These techniques
draw upon computer simulation and mathematical modeling,
thermodynamics, heat-flow analysis, and materials science to
predict the fire performance of building materials and assem-
blies.
One theoretical method, known as the “Ten Rules of Fire
Endurance Ratings,” was published by T. Z. Harmathy in the
May,  1965  edition  of  Fire  Technology.  (35)  Harmathy’s
Rules provide a foundation for extending the data within the
Appendix  Tables  to  analyze  or  upgrade  current  as  well  as
archaic building materials or assemblies.
HARMATHY’S TEN RULES
Rule  1:  The  “thermal”
1
  fire  endurance  of  a  construction
consisting  of  a  number  of  parallel  layers  is  greater  than  the
sum  of  the  “thermal”  fire  endurances  characteristic  of  the
individual layers when exposed separately to fire.
The  minimum  performance  of  an  untested  assembly  can
be  estimated  if  the  fire  endurance  of  the  individual  compo-
nents is known. Though the exact rating of the assembly can-
not  be  stated,  the  endurance  of  the  assembly  is  greater  than
the sum of the endurance of the components.
When  a  building  assembly  or  component  is  found  to  be
deficient, the fire endurance can be upgraded by providing a
protective membrane. This membrane could be a new layer of
brick,  plaster,  or  drywall.  The  fire  endurance  of  this  mem-
brane is called the “finish rating.” Appendix Tables 1.5.1 and
1.5.2  contain  the  finish  ratings  for  the  most  commonly
employed materials. (See also the notes to Rule 2).
The test criteria for the finish rating is the same as for the
thermal  fire  endurance  of  the  total  assembly:  average  tem-
perature increases of 250°F (121°C) above ambient or 325°F
(163°C) above ambient at any one place with the membrane
1.   The “thermal” fire endurance is the time at which the average temperature on the unexposed side of a construction exceeds its initial value by 250° when the
other side is exposed to the “standard” fire specified by ASTM Test Method E-19. 

RESOURCE A—GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
RESOURCE A-82021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE
being exposed to the fire. The temperature is measured at the
interface of the assembly and the protective membrane.
Rule  2:  The  fire  endurance  of  a  construction  does  not
decrease with the addition of further layers.
Harmathy notes that this rule is a consequence of the pre-
vious  rule.  Its  validity  follows  from  the  fact  that  the  addi-
tional layers increase both the resistance to heat flow and the
heat  capacity  of  the  construction.  This,  in  turn,  reduces  the
rate of temperature rise at the unexposed surface.
This  rule  is  not  just  restricted  to  “thermal”  performance
but  affects  the  other  fire  test  criteria:  direct  flame  passage,
cotton  waste  ignition,  and  load  bearing  performance.  This
means that certain restrictions must be imposed on the mate-
rials to be added and on the loading conditions. One restric-
tion  is  that  a  new  layer,  if  applied  to  the  exposed  surface,
must not produce additional thermal stresses in the construc-
tion, i.e., its thermal expansion characteristics must be similar
to  those  of  the  adjacent  layer.  Each  new  layer  must  also  be
capable  of  contributing  enough  additional  strength  to  the
assembly to sustain the added dead load. If this requirement is
not  fulfilled,  the  allowable  live  load  must  be  reduced  by  an
amount equal to the weight of the new layer. Because of these
limitations,  this  rule  should  not  be  applied  without  careful
consideration.
Particular  care  must  be  taken  if  the  material  added  is  a
good thermal insulator. Properly located, the added insulation
could  improve  the  “thermal”  performance  of  the  assembly.
Improperly located, the insulation could block necessary ther-
mal  transmission  through  the  assembly,  thereby  subjecting
the  structural  elements  to  greater  temperatures  for  longer
periods of time, and could cause premature structural failure
of the supporting members.
Rule  3:  The  fire  endurance  of  constructions  containing
continuous air gaps or cavities is greater than the fire endur-
ance of similar constructions of the same weight, but contain-
ing no air gaps or cavities.
By providing for voids in a construction, additional resis-
tances are produced in the path of heat flow. Numerical heat
flow analyses indicate that a 10 to 15 percent increase in fire
endurance can be achieved by creating an air gap at the mid-
plane of a brick wall. Since the gross volume is also increased
by the presence of voids, the air gaps and cavities have a ben-
eficial  effect  on  stability  as  well.  However,  constructions
containing  combustible  materials  within  an  air  gap  may  be
regarded  as  exceptions  to  this  rule  because  of  the  possible
development of burning in the gap.
There are numerous examples of this rule in the tables. For
instance:
Table  1.1.4;  Item  W-8-M-82:  Cored  concrete  masonry,
nominal 8 inch thick wall with one unit in wall thickness and
with 62 percent minimum of solid material in each unit, load
bearing (80 PSI). Fire endurance: 2
1
/
2
 hours.
Table  1.1.5;  Item  W-10-M-11:  Cored  concrete  masonry,
nominal  10  inch  thick  wall  with  two  units  in  wall  thickness
and  a  2-inch  (51  mm)  air  space,  load  bearing  (80  PSI).  The
units are essentially the same as item W-8-M-82. Fire endur-
ance: 3
1
/
2
 hours.
These  walls  show  1  hour  greater  fire  endurance  by  the
addition of the 2-inch (51 mm) air space.
Rule 4: The farther an air gap or cavity is located from the
exposed  surface,  the  more  beneficial  is  its  effect  on  the  fire
endurance.
Radiation dominates the heat transfer across an air gap or
cavity,  and  it  is  markedly  higher  where  the  temperature  is
higher. 
The air gap or cavity is thus a poor insulator if it is located
in a region which attains high temperatures during fire expo-
sure.
Some of the clay tile designs take advantage of these fac-
tors. The double cell design, for instance, ensures that there is
a cavity near the unexposed face. Some floor/ceiling assem-
blies have air gaps or cavities near the top surface and these
enhance their thermal performance.
Rule  5:  The  fire  endurance  of  a  construction  cannot  be
increased   by   increasing   the   thickness   of   a   completely
enclosed air layer.
Harmathy notes that there is evidence that if the thickness
of  the  air  layer  is  larger  than  about  
1
/
2
  inch  (12.7  mm),  the
heat  transfer  through  the  air  layer  depends  only  on  the  tem-
perature of the bounding surfaces, and is practically indepen-
dent of the distance between them. This rule is not applicable
if  the  air  layer  is  not  completely  enclosed,  i.e.,  if  there  is  a
possibility of fresh air entering the gap at an appreciable rate.
Rule  6:  Layers  of  materials  of  low  thermal  conductivity
are  better  utilized  on  that  side  of  the  construction  on  which
fire is more likely to happen.
As  in  Rule  4,  the  reason  lies  in  the  heat  transfer  process,
though  the  conductivity  of  the  solid  is  much  less  dependent
on the ambient temperature of the materials. The low thermal
conductor creates a substantial temperature differential to be
established across its thickness under transient heat flow con-
ditions. This rule may not be applicable to materials undergo-
ing  physico-chemical  changes  accompanied  by  significant
heat absorption or heat evolution.
Rule 7: The fire endurance of asymmetrical constructions
depends on the direction of heat flow.
This  rule  is  a  consequence  of  Rules  4  and  6,  as  well  as
other  factors.  This  rule  is  useful  in  determining  the  relative
protection  of  corridors  and  walls  enclosing  an  exit  stairway
from the surrounding spaces. In addition, there are often situ-
ations where a fire is more likely, or potentially more severe,
from one side or the other.
Rule  8:  The  presence  of  moisture,  if  it  does  not  result  in
explosive spalling, increases the fire endurance.
The  flow  of  heat  into  an  assembly  is  greatly  hindered  by
the  release  and  evaporation  of  the  moisture  found  within
cementitious  materials  such  as  gypsum,  Portland  cement,  or
magnesium oxychloride. Harmathy has shown that the gain in
fire  endurance  may  be  as  high  as  8  percent  for  each  percent
(by volume) of moisture in the construction. It is the moisture
chemically bound within the construction material at the time
of  manufacture  or  processing  that  leads  to  increased  fire
endurance.  There  is  no  direct  relationship  between  the  rela-

RESOURCE A—GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
2021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODERESOURCE A-9
tive  humidity  of  the  air  in  the  pores  of  the  material  and  the
increase in fire endurance.
Under  certain  conditions  there  may  be  explosive  spalling
of  low  permeability  cementitious  materials  such  as  dense
concrete. In general, one can assume that extremely old con-
crete  has  developed  enough  minor  cracking  that  this  factor
should not be significant.
Rule 9: Load-supporting elements, such as beams, girders
and joists, yield higher fire endurances when subjected to fire
endurance tests as parts of floor, roof, or ceiling assemblies
than they would when tested separately.
One  of  the  fire  endurance  test  criteria  is  the  ability  of  a
load-supporting element to carry its design load. The element
will be deemed to have failed when the load can no longer be
supported.
Failure  usually  results  for  two  reasons.  Some  materials,
particularly  steel  and  other  metals,  lose  much  of  their  struc-
tural strength at elevated temperatures. Physical deflection of
the supporting element, due to decreased strength or thermal
expansion,  causes  a  redistribution  of  the  load  forces  and
stresses   throughout   the   element.   Structural   failure   often
results  because  the  supporting  element  is  not  designed  to
carry the redistributed load.
Roof,  floor,  and  ceiling  assemblies  have  primary  (e.g.,
beams) and secondary (e.g., floor joists) structural members.
Since  the  primary  load-supporting  elements  span  the  largest
distances,  their  deflection  becomes  significant  at  a  stage
when  the  strength  of  the  secondary  members  (including  the
roof  or  floor  surface)  is  hardly  affected  by  the  heat.  As  the
secondary  members  follow  the  deflection  of  the  primary
load-supporting element, an increasingly larger portion of the
load is transferred to the secondary members.
When  load-supporting  elements  are  tested  separately,  the
imposed  load  is  constant  and  equal  to  the  design  load
throughout the test. By definition, no distribution of the load
is possible because the element is being tested by itself. With-
out any other structural members to which the load could be
transferred, the individual elements cannot yield a higher fire
endurance than they do when tested as parts of a floor, roof or
ceiling assembly.
Rule  10:  The  load-supporting  elements  (beams,  girders,
joists,  etc.)  of  a  floor,  roof,  or  ceiling  assembly  can  be
replaced  by  such  other  load-supporting  elements  which,
when tested separately, yielded fire endurances not less than
that of the assembly.
This  rule  depends  on  Rule  9  for  its  validity.  A  beam  or
girder,  if  capable  of  yielding  a  certain  performance  when
tested separately, will yield an equally good or better perfor-
mance when it forms a part of a floor, roof, or ceiling assem-
bly. It must be emphasized that the supporting element of one
assembly must not be replaced by the supporting element of
another assembly if the performance of this latter element is
not known from a separate (beam) test. Because of the load-
reducing effect of the secondary elements that results from a
test  performed  on  an  assembly,  the  performance  of  the  sup-
porting element alone cannot be evaluated by simple arithme-
tic.  This  rule  also  indicates  the  advantage  of  performing
separate fire tests on primary load-supporting elements.

endurance is required. Is this assembly capable of providing a
2-hour protection?
Solution
(1)  This partition does not appear in the Appendix Tables.
(2)  Bricks  of  this  thickness  yield  fire  endurances  of
approximately 75 minutes (Table 1.1.2, Item W-4-M-
2).
(3)  The 1
1
/
4
 inch (32 mm) thick plywood has a finish rat-
ing of 30 minutes.
(4)  The 
3
/
8
 inch (9.5 mm) gypsum wallboard has a finish
rating of 10 minutes.
(5)  Using  the  recommended  values  from  the  tables  and
applying Rule 1, the fire endurance (FI) of the assem-
bly is larger than the sum of the individual layers, or
FI > 75 + 30 + 10 = 115 minutes
Discussion
This example illustrates how the Appendix Tables can be uti-
lized to determine the fire resistance of assemblies not explic-
itly listed.
Example 2
Problem
(1)  A  number  of  buildings  to  be  rehabilitated  have  the
same type of roof slab which is supported with differ-
ent structural elements.
(2)  The  designer  and  contractor  would  like  to  determine
whether or not this roof slab is capable of yielding a 2-
hour fire endurance. According to a rigorous interpre-
tation of ASTM E119, however, only the roof assem-
bly,  including  the  roof  slab  as  well  as  the  cover  and
the supporting elements, can be subjected to a fire test.

Therefore,  a  fire  endurance  classification  cannot  be
issued for the slabs separately.
(3)  The  designer  and  contractor  believe  this  slab  will
yield a 2-hour fire endurance even without the cover,
and  any  beam  of  at  least  2-hour  fire  endurance  will
provide satisfactory support. Is it possible to obtain a
classification for the slab separately?
Solution
(1)  The answer to the question is yes.
(2)  According  to  Rule  10  it  is  not  contrary  to  common
sense  to  test  and  classify  roofs  and  supporting  ele-
ments separately. Furthermore, according to Rule 2, if
the  roof  slabs  actually  yield  a  2-hour  fire  endurance,
the  endurance  of  an  assembly,  including  the  slabs,
cannot be less than 2 hours.
(3)  The  recommended  procedure  would  be  to  review  the
tables  to  see  if  the  slab  appears  as  part  of  any  tested
roof or floor/ceiling assembly. The supporting system
can  be  regarded  as  separate  from  the  slab  specimen,
and  the  fire  endurance  of  the  assembly  listed  in  the
table  is  at  least  the  fire  endurance  of  the  slab.  There
would have to be an adjustment for the weight of the
roof  cover  in  the  allowable  load  if  the  test  specimen
did not contain a cover.
(4)  The  supporting  structure  or  element  would  have  to
have at least a 2-hour fire endurance when tested sepa-
rately.
Discussion
If  the  tables  did  not  include  tests  on  assemblies  which  con-
tained the slab, one procedure would be to assemble the roof
slabs  on  any  convenient  supporting  system  (not  regarded  as
part  of  the  specimen)  and  to  subject  them  to  a  load  which,
besides  the  usually  required  superimposed  load,  includes
some allowances for the weight of the cover.
Example 3
Problem
A  steel-joisted  floor  and  ceiling  assembly  is  known  to  have
yielded a fire endurance of 1 hour and 35 minutes. At a cer-
tain  location,  a  2-hour  endurance  is  required.  What  is  the
most  economical  way  of  increasing  the  fire  endurance  by  at
least 25 minutes?

Solution
(1)  The most effective technique would be to increase the
ceiling plaster thickness. Existing coats of paint would
have to be removed and the surface properly prepared
before the new plaster could be applied. Other materi-
als (e.g., gypsum wallboard) could also be considered.
(2)  There may be other techniques based on other princi-
ples,  but  an  examination  of  the  drawings  would  be
necessary.
Discussion
(1)  The additional plaster has at least three effects:
a) The layer of plaster is increased and thus there is a
gain of fire endurance (Rule 1).
b) There  is  a  gain  due  to  shifting  the  air  gap  farther
from the exposed surface (Rule 4).
c) There is more moisture in the path of heat flow to
the structural elements (Rules 7 and 8).
(2)  The  increase  in  fire  endurance  would  be  at  least  as
large  as  that  of  the  finish  rating  for  the  added  thick-
ness  of  plaster.  The  combined  effects  in  (1)  above
would  further  increase  this  by  a  factor  of  2  or  more,
depending upon the geometry of the assembly.
Example 4
Problem
The  fire  endurance  of  item  W-10-M-l  in  Table  1.1.5  is  4
hours. This wall consists of two 3
3
/
4
 inch (95 mm) thick lay-
ers  of  structural  tiles  separated  by  a  2-inch  (51  mm)  air  gap
and 
3
/
4
  inch  (19  mm)  Portland  cement  plaster  or  stucco  on
both  sides.  If  the  actual  wall  in  the  building  is  identical  to
item W-10-M-1 except that it has a 4-inch (102 mm) air gap,
can the fire endurance be estimated at 5 hours?
Solution
The answer to the question is no for the reasons contained in
Rule 5.
Example 5
Problem
In  order  to  increase  the  insulating  value  of  its  precast  roof
slabs,  a  company  has  decided  to  use  two  layers  of  different
concretes. The lower layer of the slabs, where the strength of
the  concrete  is  immaterial  (all  the  tensile  load  is  carried  by
the  steel  reinforcement),  would  be  made  with  a  concrete  of
low  strength  but  good  insulating  value.  The  upper  layer,
where the concrete is supposed to carry the compressive load,
would  remain  the  original  high  strength,  high  thermal  con-
ductivity  concrete.  How  will  the  fire  endurance  of  the  slabs
be affected by the change?
Solution
The effect on the thermal fire endurance is beneficial:
(1)  The total resistance to heat flow of the new slabs has
been  increased  due  to  the  replacement  of  a  layer  of
high thermal conductivity by one of low conductivity.
(2)  The  layer  of  low  conductivity  is  on  the  side  more
likely  to  be  exposed  to  fire,  where  it  is  more  effec-
tively  utilized  according  to  Rule  6.  The  layer  of  low
thermal  conductivity  also  provides  better  protection
for the steel reinforcement, thereby extending the time
before reaching the temperature at which the creep of
steel becomes significant.
3.3
“THICKNESS DESIGN” STRATEGY
The “thickness design” strategy is based upon Harmathy’s
Rules  1  and  2.  This  design  approach  can  be  used  when  the
construction materials have been identified and measured, but
the specific assembly cannot be located within the tables. The
tables  should  be  surveyed  again  for  thinner  walls  of  like
material and construction detail that have yielded the desired
or greater fire endurance. If such an assembly can be found,
then the thicker walls in the building have more than enough
fire  resistance.  The  thickness  of  the  walls  thus  becomes  the
principal concern.
This  approach  can  also  be  used  for  floor/ceiling  assem-
blies,  except  that  the  thickness  of  the  cover
1
  and  the  slab
become   the   central   concern.   The   fire   resistance   of   the
untested  assembly  will  be  at  least  the  fire  resistance  of  an
assembly  listed  in  the  table  having  a  similar  design  but  with
less cover and/or thinner slabs. For other structural elements
(e.g.,  beams  and  columns),  the  element  listed  in  the  table
must also be of a similar design but with less cover thickness.
3.4
EVALUATION OF DOORS
A separate section on doors has been included because the
process  for  evaluation  presented  below  differs  from  those
suggested previously for other building elements. The impact
of  unprotected  openings  or  penetrations  in  fire  resistant
assemblies has been detailed in Part 2.3 above. It is sufficient
to note here that openings left unprotected will likely lead to
failure of the barrier under actual fire conditions.
For  other  types  of  building  elements  (e.g.,  beams,  col-
umns), the Appendix Tables can be used to establish a mini-
mum  level  of  fire  performance.  The  benefit  to  rehabilitation
is that the need for a full-scale fire test is then eliminated. For
doors,  however,  this  cannot  be  done.  The  data  contained  in
Appendix  Table  5.1,  Resistance  of  Doors  to  Fire  Exposure,
can only provide guidance as to whether a successful fire test
is even feasible.
For example, a door required to have 1 hour fire resistance
is noted in the tables as providing only 5 minutes. The likeli-
hood  of  achieving  the  required  1  hour,  even  if  the  door  is
upgraded, is remote. The ultimate need for replacement of the
doors  is  reasonably  clear,  and  the  expense  and  time  needed
for testing can be saved. However, if the performance docu-
mented  in  the  table  is  near  or  in  excess  of  what  is  being
required, then a fire test should be conducted. The test docu-
1.   Cover: the protective layer or membrane of material which slows the flow of heat to the structural elements.

RESOURCE A—GUIDELINES ON FIRE RATINGS OF ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLIES
RESOURCE A-122021 VIRGINIA EXISTING BUILDING CODE
mentation  can  then  be  used  as  evidence  of  compliance  with
the required level of performance.
The table entries cannot be used as the sole proof of per-
formance of the door in question because there are too many
unknown  variables  which  could  measurably  affect  fire  per-
formance. The wood may have dried over the years; coats of
flammable varnish could have been added. Minor deviations
in the internal construction of a door can result in significant
differences  in  performance.  Methods  of  securing  inserts  in
panel  doors  can  vary.  The  major  non-destructive  method  of
analysis, an x-ray, often cannot provide the necessary detail.
It is for these, and similar reasons, that a fire test is still felt to
be necessary.
It  is  often  possible  to  upgrade  the  fire  performance  of  an
existing  door.  Sometimes,  “as  is”  and  modified  doors  are
evaluated  in  a  single  series  of  tests  when  failure  of  the
unmodified  door  is  expected.  Because  doors  upgraded  after
an initial failure must be tested again, there is a potential sav-
ings of time and money.
The  most  common  problems  encountered  are  plain  glass,
panel  inserts  of  insufficient  thickness,  and  improper  fit  of  a
door  in  its  frame.  The  latter  problem  can  be  significant
because a fire can develop a substantial positive pressure, and
the fire will work its way through otherwise innocent-looking
gaps between door and frame.
 One approach to solving these problems is as follows. The
plain glass is replaced with approved or listed wire glass in a
steel frame. The panel inserts can be upgraded by adding an
additional layer of material. Gypsum wallboard is often used
for this purpose. Intumescent paint applied to the edges of the
door and frame will expand when exposed to fire, forming an
effective  seal  around  the  edges.  This  seal,  coupled  with  the
generally even thermal expansion of a wood door in a wood
frame, can prevent the passage of flames and other fire gases.
Figure 3 below illustrates these solutions.
Because  the  interior  construction  of  a  door  cannot  be
determined by a visual inspection, there is no absolute guar-
antee  that  the  remaining  doors  are  identical  to  the  one(s)
removed from the building and tested. But the same is true for
doors  constructed  today,  and  reason  and  judgment  must  be
applied.  Doors  that  appear  identical  upon  visual  inspection
can be weighed. If the weights are reasonably close, the doors
can be assumed to be identical and therefore provide the same
level  of  fire  performance.  Another  approach  is  to  fire  test
more than one door or to dismantle doors selected at random
to see if they had been constructed in the same manner. Orig-
inal  building  plans  showing  door  details  or  other  records
showing  that  doors  were  purchased  at  one  time  or  obtained
from  a  single  supplier  can  also  be  evidence  of  similar  con-
struction.

More  often  though,  it  is  what  is  visible  to  the  eye  that  is
most significant. The investigator should carefully check the
condition and fit of the door and frame, and for frames out of
plumb or separating from the wall. Door closers, latches, and
hinges  must  be  examined  to  see  that  they  function  properly
and are tightly secured. If these are in order and the door and
frame have passed a full-scale test, there can be a reasonable
basis for allowing the existing doors to remain.

SUMMARY
This   section   summarizes   the   various   approaches   and
design  solutions  discussed  in  the  preceding  sections  of  the
guideline.  The  term  “structural  system”  includes:  frames,
beams, columns, and other structural elements. “Cover” is a
protective layer(s) of materials or membrane which slows the
flow  of  heat  to  the  structural  elements.  It  cannot  be  stressed
too  strongly  that  the  fire  endurance  of  actual  building  ele-
ments can be greatly reduced or totally negated by removing
part  of  the  cover  to  allow  pipes,  ducts,  or  conduits  to  pass
through the element. This must be repaired in the rehabilita-
tion process.
The following approaches shall be considered equivalent.
4.1  The  fire  resistance  of  a  building  element  can  be  estab-
lished  from  the  Appendix  Tables.  This  is  subject  to  the  fol-
lowing limitations:
The building element in the rehabilitated building shall be
constructed  of  the  same  materials  with  the  same  nominal
dimensions as stated in the tables.
All  penetrations  in  the  building  element  or  its  cover  for
services such as electricity, plumbing, and HVAC shall be
packed  with  noncombustible  cementitious  materials  and
so fixed that the packing material will not fall out when it
loses its water of hydration.
The  effects  of  age  and  wear  and  tear  shall  be  repaired  so
that the building element is sound and the original thickness
of  all  components,  particularly  covers  and  floor  slabs,  is
maintained.
This  approach  essentially  follows  the  approach  taken  by
model  building  codes.  The  assembly  must  appear  in  a  table
either  published  in  or  accepted  by  the  code  for  a  given  fire-
resistance rating to be recognized and accepted.
4.2 The fire resistance of a building element which does not
explicitly appear in the Appendix Tables can be established if
one  or  more  elements  of  same  design  but  different  dimen-
sions  have  been  listed  in  the  tables.  For  walls,  the  existing
element must be thicker than the one listed. For floor/ceiling
assemblies,  the  assembly  listed  in  the  table  must  have  the
same or less cover and the same or thinner slab constructed of
the  same  material  as  the  actual  floor/ceiling  assembly.  For
other structural elements, the element listed in the table must
be of a similar design but with less cover thickness. The fire
resistance  in  all  instances  shall  be  the  fire  resistance  recom-
mended  in  the  table.  This  is  subject  to  the  following  limita-
tions:
The  actual  element  in  the  rehabilitated  building  shall  be
constructed  of  the  same  materials  as  listed  in  the  table.
Only the following dimensions may vary from those spec-
ified:  for  walls,  the  overall  thickness  must  exceed  that
specified  in  the  table;  for  floor/ceiling  assemblies,  the
thickness of the cover and the slab must be greater than, or
equal to, that specified in the table; for other structural ele-
ments, the thickness of the cover must be greater than that
specified in the table.
All  penetrations  in  the  building  element  or  its  cover  for
services  such  as  electricity,  plumbing,  or  HVAC  shall  be
packed  with  noncombustible  cementitious  materials  and
so fixed that the packing material will not fall out when it
loses its water of hydration.
The  effects  of  age  and  wear  and  tear  shall  be  repaired  so
that  the  building  element  is  sound  and  the  original  thick-
ness of all components, particularly covers and floor slabs,
is maintained.
This  approach  is  an  application  of  the  “thickness  design”
concept  presented  in  Part  3.3  of  the  guideline.  There  should
be many instances when a thicker building element was uti-
lized than the one listed in the Appendix Tables. This guide-
line  recognizes  the  inherent  superiority  of  a  thicker  design.
Note:  “thickness  design”  for  floor/ceiling  assemblies  and
structural  elements  refers  to  cover  and  slab  thickness  rather
than total thickness.
The  “thickness  design”  concept  is  essentially  a  special
case  of  Harmathy’s  Rules  (specifically  Rules  1  and  2).  It
should  be  recognized  that  the  only  source  of  data  is  the
Appendix Tables. If other data are used, it must be in connec-
tion with the approach below.
4.3  The  fire  resistance  of  building  elements  can  be  estab-
lished by applying Harmathy’s Ten Rules of Fire Resistance
Ratings as set forth in Part 3.2 of the guideline. This is subject
to the following limitations:
The data from the tables can be utilized subject to the lim-
itations in 4.2 above.
Test reports from recognized journals or published papers
can  be  used  to  support  data  utilized  in  applying  Harma-
thy’s Rules.
Calculations  utilizing  recognized  and  well  established
computational techniques can be used in applying Harma-
thy’s Rules. These include, but are not limited to, analysis
of heat flow, mechanical properties, deflections, and load
bearing capacity.

 PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE
The  tables  and  histograms  which  follow  are  to  be  used
only  within  the  analytical  framework  detailed  in  the  main
body of this guideline.
Histograms precede any table with 10 or more entries. The
use and interpretation of these histograms is explained in Part
2  of  the  guideline.  The  tables  are  in  a  format  similar  to  that
found  in  the  model  building  codes.  The  following  example,
taken from an entry in Table 1.1.2, best explains the table for-
mat.
1.    Item  Code:  The  item  code  consists  of  a  four  place
series  in  the  general  form  w-x-y-z  in  which  each
member of the series denotes the following:
w    =   Type  of  building  element  (e.g.,  W=Walls;
F=Floors, etc.)
x    =   The building element thickness rounded down
to   the   nearest   1-inch   increment   (e.g.,   4
5
/
8
inches is rounded off to 4 inches)
y     =   The  general  type  of  material  from  which  the
building     element     is     constructed     (e.g.,
M=Masonry; W=Wood, etc.)
z     =   The  item  number  of  the  particular  building
element in a given table
The  item  code  shown  in  the  example  W-4-M-50
denotes the following:
W =    Wall, as the building element
4   =    Wall  thickness  in  the  range  of  4  inches  (102
mm) to less than 5 inches (127 mm)
M  =   Masonry construction
50 =   The 50th entry in Table 1.1.2
2.    The specific name or heading of this column identifies
the  dimensions  which,  if  varied,  has  the  greatest
impact  on  fire  resistance.  The  critical  dimension  for
walls, the example here, is thickness. It is different for
other building elements (e.g., depth for beams; mem-
brane  thickness  for  some  floor/ceiling  assemblies).
The table entry is the named dimension of the building
element  measured  at  the  time  of  actual  testing  to
within ±
1
/
8
 inch (3.2 mm) tolerance. The thickness tab-
ulated includes facings where facings are a part of the
wall construction.
3.    Construction Details: The construction details provide
a brief description of the manner in which the building
element was constructed.
4.    Performance: This heading is subdivided into two col-
umns. The column labeled “Load” will either list the
load that the building element was subjected to during
the fire test or it will contain a note number which will
list  the  load  and  any  other  significant  details.  If  the
building  element  was  not  subjected  to  a  load  during
the test, this column will contain “n/a,” which means
“not applicable.”
The  second  column  under  performance  is  labeled
“Time”  and  denotes  the  actual  fire  endurance  time
observed in the fire test.
5.    Reference  Number:  This  heading  is  subdivided  into
three   columns:   Pre-BMS-92;   BMS-92;   and   Post-
BMS-92.  The  table  entry  under  this  column  is  the
number in the Bibliography of the original source ref-
erence for the test data.
6.    Notes: Notes are provided at the end of each table to
allow a more detailed explanation of certain aspects of
the  test.  In  certain  tables  the  notes  given  to  this  col-
umn  have  also  been  listed  under  the  “Construction
Details” and/or “Load” columns.
7.    Rec  Hours:  This  column  lists  the  recommended  fire
endurance  rating,  in  hours,  of  a  building  element.  In
some  cases,  the  recommended  fire  endurance  will  be
less  than  that  listed  under  the  “Time”  column.  In  no
case  is  the  “Rec  Hours”  greater  than  given  in  the
“Time” column.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 0.00689 MPa, °C = [(°F) - 32]/1.8.
Notes:
1.  Failure mode—flame thru.
2.  Passed 2-hour fire test (Grade “C” fire res. - British).
3.  Passed hose stream test.
4.  Tested at NBS under ASA Spec. No. A2-1934. As nonload bearing partitions.
5.  Tested at NBS under ASA Spec. No. 42-1934 (ASTM C19-33) except that hose stream testing where carried was run on test specimens exposed for full test
duration, not for a reduced period as is contemporarily done.
6.  Failure by thermal criteria—maximum temperature rise 325°F.
7.  Hose stream failure.
8.  Hose stream—pass.
9.  Specimen removed prior to any failure occurring.
10.  Failure mode—collapse.
11.  For clay tile walls, unless the source or density of the clay can be positively identified or determined, it is suggested that the lowest hourly rating for the fire
endurance  of  a  clay  tile  partition  of  that  thickness  be  followed.  Identified  sources  of  clay  showing  longer  fire  endurance  can  lead  to  longer  time
recommendations.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 0.00689 MPa.
Notes:
1.  Tested as NBS under ASA Spec. No. A 2-1934.
2.  Failure mode—maximum temperature rise.
3.  Treated at NBS under ASA Spec. No. 42-1934 (ASTM C19-53) except that hose stream testing where carried out was run on test specimens exposed for full
test duration, not for or reduced period as is contemporarily done.
4.  For clay tile walls, unless the source the clay can be positively identified, it is suggested that the most pessimistic hour rating for the fire endurance of a clay
tile partition of that thickness to be followed. Identified sources of clay showing longer fire endurance can lead to longer time recommendations.
5.  See appendix for construction and design details for clay tile walls.
6.  Failure mode—flame thru or crack formation showing flames.
7.  Hole formed at 25 minutes; partition collapsed at 42 minutes or removal from furnace.
8.  Failure mode—collapse.
9.  Hose stream pass.
10.  Hose stream hole formed in specimen.
11.  Load: 80 psi for gross wall cross sectional area.
12.  One cell in wall thickness.
13.  Two cells in wall thickness.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 0.00689 MPa.
Notes:
1.  Tested at NBS under ASA Spec. No. 43-1934 (ASTM C19-53) except that hose stream testing where carried out was run on test specimens exposed for full
test duration, not for a reduced period as is contemporarily done.
2.  Failure by thermal criteria—maximum temperature rise.
3.  For clay tile walls, unless the source or density of the clay can be positively identified or determined, it is suggested that the lowest hourly rating for the fire
endurance  of  a  clay  tile  partition  of  that  thickness  be  followed.  Identified  sources  of  clay  showing  longer  fire  endurance  can  lead  to  longer  time
recommendations.
4.  See Note 55 for construction and design details for clay tile walls.
5.  Tested at NBS under ASA Spec. No. A2-1934.
6.  Failure mode—collapse.
7.  Collapsed on removal from furnace at 1 hour 9 minutes.
8.  Hose stream—failed.
9.  Hose stream—passed.
10.  No end point met in test.
11.  Wall collapsed at 1 hour 28 minutes.
12.  One cell in wall thickness.
13.  Two cells in wall thickness.
14.  Double shells plus one cell in wall thickness.
15.  One cell in wall thickness, cells filled with broken tile, crushed stone, slag, cinders or sand mixed with mortar.
16.  Dense hard-burned clay or shale tile.

General Note:
The construction details of the wall assemblies are as complete as the source documentation will permit. Data on the method of attachment of facings and the
gauge of steel studs was provided when known. The cross-sectional area of the steel stud can be computed, thereby permitting a reasoned estimate of actual
loading conditions. For load-bearing assemblies, the maximum allowable stress for the steel studs has been provided in the table “Notes.” More often, it is the
thermal properties of the facing materials, rather than the specific gauge of the steel, that will determine the degree of fire resistance. This is particularly true for
nonbearing wall assemblies.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square inch = 0.00689 MPa.
Notes:
1. Failure mode—local back face temperature rise.
2. Ratings are for any usual type of nonbearing metal framing providing a minimum 2 inches air space.
3. Facing materials secured to lightweight steel studs not less than 3 inches deep.
4. Rating based on loading to develop a maximum stress of 7270 psi for net area of each stud.
5. Spacing of steel studs must be sufficient to develop adequate rigidity in the metal-lath or gypsum-plaster base.
6. As per Note 4 but load/stud not to exceed 5120 psi.
General Note:
The construction details of the wall assemblies are as complete as the source documentation will permit. Data on the method of attachment of facings and the
gauge  of  steel  studs  was  provided  when  known.  The  cross  sectional  area  of  the  steel  stud  can  be  computed,  thereby  permitting  a  reasoned  estimate  of  actual

, °C = [(°F) - 32]/1.8.
Notes:
1.  The finish rating is the time required to obtain an average temperature rise of 250°F, or a single point rise of 325°F, at the interface between the material being
rated and he substrate being protected.
2.  Tested in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials, ASA No. A2-1932.
3.  Plaster ratios as follows: first ratio is for scratch coat, weight of dry plaster: weight of dry sand; second ratio is for the brown coat.
General Note:
The finish rating of thinner materials, particularly thinner woods, have not been listed because the possible effects of shrinkage, warpage and aging cannot be
predicted.

Notes: 
1. Load concentrated at mid span. 
2. Achieved 6 hour fire rating (Grade “A,” British).
3.
5. Section 43.147 of the 1979 edition of the Uniform Building Code Standards provides: 
“A restrained condition in fire tests, as used in this standard, is one in which expansion at the supports of a load-carrying element resulting from the effects of
the fire is resisted by forces external to the element. An unrestrained condition is one in which the load-carrying element is free to expand and rotate at its
support.”
“Restraint in buildings is defined as follows: Floor and roof assemblies and individual beams in buildings shall be considered restrained when the surrounding
or supporting structure is capable of resisting the thermal expansion throughout the range of anticipated elevated temperatures. Construction not complying . . .
is assumed to be free to rotate and expand and shall be considered as unrestrained.”
“Restraint may be provided by the lateral stiffness of supports for floor and roof assemblies and intermediate beams forming part of the assembly. In order to
develop restraint, connections must adequately transfer thermal thrusts to such supports. The rigidity of adjoining panels or structures shall be considered in
assessing the capability of a structure to resist therm expansion.”
Because it is difficult to determine whether an existing building’s structural system is capable of providing the required restraint, the lower hourly ratings of a
similar but unrestrained assembly have been recommended.

Notes: 
1.  All door frames were of standard lumber construction.
2.  Wood door stop protected by asbestos millboard. 
3.  Wood door stop protected by sheet metal. 
4.  Door frame protected with sheet metal and weather strip. 
5.  Surface painted with intumescent coating. 
6.  Door edge sheet metal protected. 
7.  Door edge intumescent paint protected. 
8.  Formal steel frame and door stop. 
9.  Door opened into furnace at 12 feet. 
10.  Similar door opened into furnace at 12 feet. 
11.  The doors reported in these tests represent the type contemporaries used as 20-minute solid-core wood doors. The test results demonstrate the necessity of
having wall anchored metal frames, minimum cleaners possible between door, frame and stops. They also indicate the utility of long throw latches and the
possible use of intumescent paints to seal doors to frames in event of a fire. 
12.  Minimum working clearance and good latch closure are absolute necessities for effective containment for all such working door assemblies. 
13.  Based on British tests. 
14.  Failure at door-frame interface.

Changes to the Code 
Development Process
The International Code Council is revising its 
code development process to improve the 
quality of code content by fostering a more 
in-depth vetting of code change proposals. 
Changes will take effect in 2024–2026 for the 
development of the 2027 I-Codes and will move 
the development process to an integrated and 
continuous three-year cycle. 
In the new timeline:
·	Year 1 will include two Committee Action 
Hearings for Group A Codes
·	Year 2 will include two Committee Action 
Hearings for Group B Codes
·	Year 3 will be the joint Public Comment 
Hearings and Online Governmental 
Consensus Vote for both Group A and B 
Codes
Learn more about the new 
process and download the 
new timeline here.
