    "Introduction ",
    "The Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC) is a state regulation promulgated by the Virginia Board of Housing and Community Development, a Governor-appointed board, for the purpose of establishing minimum regulations to govern the construction and maintenance of buildings and structures. ",
    "The provisions of the USBC are based on nationally recognized model building and fire codes published by the International Code Council, Inc. The model codes are made part of the USBC through a regulatory process known as incorporation by reference. The USBC also contains administrative provisions governing the use of the model codes and establishing requirements for the enforcement of thecode by the local building departments and other code enforcement agencies. ",
    "In keeping with the designations of the USBC used previously, since the 2021 editions of the Inter",
    "national Codes are incorporated by reference into this version of the USBC, it is known as the 2021 ",
    "edition of the USBC. ",
    "Arrangement ",
    "The USBC is part of the Virginia Administrative Code (VAC), the official compilation of state regulationspublished under the authority and guidance of the Virginia Code Commission. Due to the difference inthe section numbering system between the VAC and the model codes incorporated by reference intothe USBC, the USBC utilizes a dual section numbering system. In the USBC, the VAC section numbers are listed first, followed by a section number matching the model code system. In this printing of the USBC, the VAC section numbers are omitted and only the model code numbering system is utilized. The version of the USBC containing both the VAC section numbers and the model code numbering canbe accessed through Virginia’s Legislative Information System (LIS) here: https://law.lis.virginia.gov/ admincode/title13/agency5/. ",
    "Overview ",
    "The USBC is divided into three stand-alone parts. Part I contains regulations specific to the construction of new buildings and structures and is known as the Virginia Construction Code. Part II contains regulations specific to the rehabilitation of existing buildings, including repair, alterations, additionsand change of occupancy in existing buildings and structures, and is known as the Virginia Existing Building Code. Part III of the USBC contains the regulations for the maintenance of existing structures which is enforced at the option of the local governments. It is known as the Virginia Maintenance Code. ",
    "Codes Purchased from ICC ",
    "The 2021 edition of the USBC is being made available in pamphlet form as in past editions of the USBC. Inaddition to the pamphlet form of the USBC published by DHCD, the International Code Council (ICC) publishes versions of the Virginia Construction Code, Virginia Existing Building Code, Virginia Maintenance Code and a series of Virginia specific trade codes.

    "In the ICC published versions, marginal markings are provided to distinguish between text which is part of the International Codes and text which is part of the state regulations. Double vertical linesin the margins within the body of the codes indicate state amendments to the International Codes.As in the standard printings of the International Codes, a single vertical line in the margins within the body of the code indicates a technical change from the previous edition of the International Codes.

    "Deletions from the previous editions of the International Codes are indicated in the form of an arrow () in the margin where an entire section, paragraph, exception or table has been deleted or an item in a list of items or a table has been deleted. Deletions to the Virginia Code are indicated with an open caret (>) in the margin. ",

    "101.1 Short title. The Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, Part II, Existing Buildings, may be cited as the “Virginia Existing Building Code” or as the “VEBC.” ",
    "101.2 Incorporation by reference. Chapters 2–16 of the 2021 International Existing Building Code®, published by the International Code Council, Inc., are adopted and incorporated by reference to be an enforceable part of the VEBC. The term “IEBC®” means the 2021 International Existing Building Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc. Any codes and standards referenced in the IEBC are also considered to be part of the incorporation by reference, except that such codes and standards are used only to the prescribed extent of each such reference. ",
    "101.3 Numbering system. A dual numbering system is used in the VEBC to correlate the numbering system of the Virginia Administrative Code with the numbering system of the IEBC. IEBC numbering system designations are provided in the catchlines of the Virginia Administrative Code sections and cross references between sections or chapters of the VEBC use only the IEBC numbering system designations. The term “chapter” is used in the context of the numbering system of the IEBC and may mean a chapter in the VEBC, a chapter in the IEBC or a chapter in a referenced code or standard, depending on the context of the use of the term. The term “chapter” is not used to designate a chapter of the Virginia Administrative Code, unless clearly indicated. ",
    "101.4 Arrangement of code provisions. The VEBC is comprised of the combination of (i) the provisions of Chapter 1, Administration, which are established herein, (ii) Chapters 2– 16 of the IEBC, which are incorporated by reference in Section 101.2, and (iii) the changes to the text of the incorporated chapters of the IEBC that are specifically identified, including any new chapters added. The terminology “changes to the text of the incorporated chapters of the IEBC that are specifically identified, including any new chapters added” shall also be referred to as the “state amendments to the IEBC.” Such state amendments to the IEBC are set out using corresponding chapter and section numbers of the IEBC numbering system. In addition, since Chapter 1 of the IEBC is not incorporated as part of the VEBC, any reference to a provision of Chapter 1 of the IEBC in the provisions of Chapters 2–16 of the IEBC is generally invalid. However, where the purpose of such a reference would clearly correspond to a provision of Chapter 1 established herein, then the reference may be construed to be a valid reference to such corresponding Chapter 1 provision.

In accordance with § 36-99.01 of the Code of Virginia, the General Assembly of Virginia has declared that (i) there is an urgent need to improve the housing conditions of low and moderate income individuals and families, many of whom live in substandard housing, particularly in the older cities of the Commonwealth; (ii) there are large numbers of older residential buildings in the Commonwealth, both occupied and vacant, which are in urgent need of rehabilitation and must be rehabilitated if the state’s citizens are to be housed in decent, sound, and sanitary conditions; and (iii) the application of those building code requirements currently in force to housing rehabilitation has sometimes led to the imposition of costly and time-consuming requirements that result in a significant reduction in the amount of rehabilitation activity taking place.

    "The General Assembly further declares that (i) there is an urgent need to improve the existing condition of many of the Commonwealth’s stock of commercial properties, particularly in older cities; (ii) there are large numbers of older commercial buildings in the Commonwealth, both occupied and vacant, that are in urgent need of rehabilitation and that must be rehabilitated if the citizens of the Commonwealth are to be provided with decent, sound and sanitary work spaces; and (iii) the application of the existing building code to such rehabilitation has sometimes led to the imposition of costly and time-consuming requirements that result in a significant reduction in the amount of rehabilitation activity taking place.
