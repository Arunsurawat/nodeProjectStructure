    "Introduction ",
    "Development ",
    "PREFACE ",
    "This 2024 Ohio Mechanical Code is based on the 2021 International Mechanical Code® (IMC®) with incorporated Ohio changes. ",
    "The IMC establishes minimum requirements for mechanical systems using prescriptive and performance-related provisions. It is founded on broad-based principles that make possible the use of new materials and new mechanical designs. This 2021 edition is fully compatible with all of the International Codes (I-Codes®) published by the International Code Council (ICC), including the International Building Code®, International Energy Conservation Code®, International Existing Building Code®, International Fire Code®, International Fuel Gas Code®, International Green Construction Code®, International Plumbing Code®, International Private Sewage Disposal Code®, International Property Maintenance Code®, International Residential Code®, International Swimming Pool and Spa Code®, International Wildland-Urban Interface Code®, International Zoning Code® and International Code Council Performance Code®. ",
    "The I-Codes, including this International Mechanical Code, are used in a variety of ways in both the public and private sectors. Most industry professionals are familiar with the I-Codes as the basis of laws and regulations in communities across the US and in other countries. However, the impact of thecodes extends well beyond the regulatory arena, as they are used in a variety of nonregulatory settings, including: ",
    "In addition to the codes themselves, the code development process brings together building professionals on a regular basis. It provides an international forum for discussion and deliberation about building design, construction methods, safety, performance requirements, technological advances and innovative products. ",
    "This 2021 edition presents the code as originally issued, with changes reflected in the 2003 through 2018 editions and further changes approved by the ICC Code Development Process through 2019. A new edition such as this is promulgated every 3 years. ",
    "This code is founded on principles intended to establish provisions consistent with the scope of a mechanical code that adequately protects public health, safety and welfare; provisions that do not unnecessarily increase construction costs; provisions that do not restrict the use of new materials,products or methods of construction; and provisions that do not give preferential treatment to particular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction. ",
    "Maintenance ",
    "The International Mechanical Code is kept up-to-date through the review of proposed changes submitted by code enforcement officials, industry representatives, design professionals and other interestedparties. Proposed changes are carefully considered through an open code development process in which all interested and affected parties may participate. ",
    "The ICC Code Development Process reflects principles of openness, transparency, balance, due process and consensus, the principles embodied in OMB Circular A-119, which governs the federal government’s use of private-sector standards. The ICC process is open to anyone; there is no cost to participate, and people can participate without travel cost through the ICC’s cloud-based app, cdpAccess®. A broad cross-secton of interests are represented in the ICC Code Development Process. The codes, which are updated regularly, include safeguards that allow for emergency action when required for health and safety reasons. ",
    "In order to ensure that organizations with a direct and material interest in the codes have a voice inthe process, the ICC has developed partnerships with key industry segments that support the ICC’s important public safety mission. Some code development committee members were nominated by the following industry partners and approved by the ICC Board: ",
    "The code development committees evaluate and make recommendations regarding proposed changes to the codes. Their recommendations are then subject to public comment and council-wide votes. The ICC′s governmental members—public safety officials who have no financial or business interest in the outcome—cast the final votes on proposed changes. ",
    "The contents of this work are subject to change through the code development cycles and by anygovernmental entity that enacts the code into law. For more information regarding the code development process, contact the Codes and Standards Development Department of the International Code Council. ",
    "While the I-Code development procedure is thorough and comprehensive, the ICC, its members and those participating in the development of the codes disclaim any liability resulting from the publication or use of the I-Codes, or from compliance or noncompliance with their provisions. The ICC doesnot have the power or authority to police or enforce compliance with the contents of this code. ",
    "Marginal Markings ",
    "For Digital Codes Basic and Premium services, Ohio amendments to the International Codes are shown in red text. An open arrow (>) in the margin indicates I-Code text has been omitted. ",
    "For print and PDF versions of the code, double vertical lines in the margin within the body of the codeindicate Ohio amendments. An open arrow (>) in the margin indicates I-Code text has been omitted. ",
    "Coordination of the International Codes ",
    "The coordination of technical provisions is one of the strengths of the ICC family of model codes. Thecodes can be used as a complete set of complementary documents, which will provide users with fullintegration and coordination of technical provisions. Individual codes can also be used in subsets or asstand-alone documents. To make sure that each individual code is as complete as possible, some technical provisions that are relevant to more than one subject area are duplicated in some of the model codes. This allows users maximum flexibility in their application of the I-Codes. ",
    "Italicized Terms ",
    "Words and terms defined in Chapter 2, Definitions, are italicized where they appear in code text and the Chapter 2 definitions apply. Where such words and terms are not italicized, common-use definitions apply. The words and terms selected have code-specific definitions that the user should read carefully to facilitate better understanding of the code. ",
    "Adoption ",
    "The International Code Council maintains a copyright in all of its codes and standards. Maintaining copyright allows the ICC to fund its mission through sales of books, in both print and electronic formats. The ICC welcomes adoption of its codes by jurisdictions that recognize and acknowledge the ICC’s copyright in the code, and further acknowledge the substantial shared value of the public/privatepartnership for code development between jurisdictions and the ICC. ",
    "The ICC also recognizes the need for jurisdictions to make laws available to the public. All I-Codesand I-Standards, along with the laws of many jurisdictions, are available for free in a nondownloadableform on the ICC’s website. Jurisdictions should contact the ICC at adoptions@iccsafe.org to learn howto adopt and distribute laws based on the International Mechanical Code in a manner that provides necessary access, while maintaining the ICC’s copyright. ",
    "Effective Use of the International Mechanical Code ",
    "The International Mechanical Code® (IMC®) is a model code that regulates the design and installation of mechanical systems, appliances, appliance venting, duct and ventilation systems, combustion air provisions, hydronic systems and solar systems. The purpose of the code is to establish the minimumacceptable level of safety and to protect life and property from the potential dangers associated withthe installation and operation of mechanical systems. The code also protects the personnel that install, maintain, service and replace the systems and appliances addressed by this code. ",
    "The IMC is primarily a prescriptive code with some performance text. The code relies heavily on ",
    "product specifications and listings to provide much of the appliance and equipment installation ",
    "requirements. ",

",
    "COMMERCIAL KITCHEN HOODS. ",
    "Backshelf hood. A backshelf hood is also referred to as a low-proximity hood, or as a sidewall hood where wall mounted. Its front lower lip is low over the appliance(s) and is “set back” from the front of the appliance(s). It is always closed to the rear of the appliances by a panel where free-standing, or by a panel or wall where wall mounted, and its height above the cooking surface varies. (This style of hood can be constructed with partial end panels to increase its effectiveness in capturing the effluent generated by the cooking operation.) ",
    "Double island canopy hood. A double island canopy hood is placed over back-to-back appliances or appliancelines. It is open on all sides and overhangs both fronts and the sides of the appliance(s). It could have a wall panel between the backs of the appliances. (The fact that exhaust air is drawn from both sides of the double canopy to meet in the center causes each side of this hood to emulate a wall canopy hood, and thus it functions much the same with or without an actual wall panel between the backs of the appliances.) ",
    "Eyebrow hood. An eyebrow hood is mounted directly to the face of an appliance, such as an oven and dishwasher, above the opening(s) or door(s) from which effluent is emitted, extending past the sides and overhanging the front of the opening to capture the effluent. ",

    "Single island canopy hood. A single island canopy hood is placed over a single appliance or appliance line. It is open on all sides and overhangs the front, rear and sides of the appliance(s). A single island canopy is more susceptible to cross drafts and requires a greater exhaust airflow than an equivalent sized wall-mounted canopy to capture and contain effluent generated by the cooking operation(s). ",
